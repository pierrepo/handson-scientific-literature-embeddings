    "title": "Ionic Current Rectification in Nanopores: Effects of Nanopore Material, Electrolyte and Surface Treatment",
    "abstract": "Ionic Current Rectification (ICR) can appear in nanopores, causing a diode-like behavior that originates from different efficiency of ion transport through the pore channel with respect to the applied voltage bias polarity. This effect is particularly interesting for nanopores with a short channel length, that is smaller than 500 nm, because then the dependence of the ion current on the direction along which the ions pass through the channel is determined by the geometry and material of the nanopore, and by the ion concentration in the electrolyte. Surface charges can play an important role, and therefore nanopores consisting of multiple materials can induce ICR because of different charge distributions at the nanopore-electrolyte interface for the different material sections. In this work, we study four solid-state nanopore designs considering different geometries of charge distributions along the inner and outer surfaces of nanopores, and evaluate their impact on ICR with six different electrolytes. The direct comparison between experimental data and modeling enables to understand how the different surface charge configurations impact the ICR.",

    "title": "EnumerWating Stable Nanopores in Graphene and their Geometrical Properties Using the Combinatorics of Hexagonal Lattices",
    "abstract": "Nanopores in two-dimensional (2D) materials, including graphene, can be used for a variety of applications, such as gas separations, water desalination, and DNA sequencing. So far, however, all plausible isomeric shapes of graphene nanopores have not been enumerated. Instead, a probabilistic approach has been followed to predict nanopore shapes in 2D materials, due to the exponential increase in the number of nanopores as the size of the vacancy increases. For example, there are 12 possible isomers when N=6 atoms are removed, a number that theoretically increases to 11.7 million when N=20 atoms are removed from the graphene lattice. The development of a smaller, exhaustive dataset of stable nanopore shapes can help future experimental and theoretical studies focused on using nanoporous 2D materials in various applications. In this work, we use the theory of 2D triangular 'lattice animals' to create a library of all stable graphene nanopore shapes based on a modification of a well-known algorithm in the mathematical combinatorics of polyforms known as Redelmeier's algorithm. We show that there exists a correspondence between graphene nanopores and triangular polyforms (called polyiamonds) as well as hexagonal polyforms (called polyhexes). We develop the concept of a polyiamond ID to identify unique nanopore isomers. We also use concepts from polyiamond and polyhex geometry to eliminate unstable nanopores containing dangling atoms, bonds, and moieties. The exclusion of such unstable nanopores leads to a remarkable reduction in the possible nanopores from 11.7 million for N=20 to only 0.184 million nanopores, thereby indicating that the number of stable nanopores is almost two orders of magnitude lower and is much more tractable. Not only that, by extracting the polyhex outline, our algorithm allows searching for nanopores with dimensions and shape factors in a specified range.",

    "abstract": "Nanoporous structures play a promising role in the development of nanomechanical, nanoelectrical and biosensing devices. In addition, nanopores can be utilized as chemical and gas sensors. TiO2 is a semiconductor material, which can have a wide range of applications in nanopore-based sensors. In this study, TiO2 nanopores were prepared by electrochemical anodization. Titanium was used as the anode, while platinum was used as the cathode in an electrochemical cell filled with a hydrofluoric acid electrolyte solution. During the preparation process, titanium was converted to its oxide form. Nanostructures were synthesized under varying physical conditions, including HF concentrations of 0.5-10% and anodization times of 5-30 minutes. The resulting nanopore structures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). With a progressive increase in HF concentration (from 0.5% to 10%), the diameter of the nanopores decreased, from approximately 100 nm in diameter to 50 nm. The nanopores showed a transformation from tube-like structures to pore networks with increased HF concentration or anodization time. The results show that the dimensions and morphology of the nanopores can be controlled by alteration of the anodization conditions.",

    "title": "Water Assisted Proton Transport in Confined Nanochannels",
    "abstract": "Hydrated excess protons under hydrophobic confinement are a critical component of charge transport behavior and reactivity in nanoporous materials and biomolecular systems. Herein excess proton confinement effects are computationally investigated for sub-2 nm hydrophobic nanopores by varying the diameters (d = 0.81, 0.95, 1.09, 1.22, 1.36, 1.63, and 1.90 nm), lengths (l ~3 and ~5 nm), curvature, and chirality of cylindrical carbon nanotube (CNT) nanopores. CNTs with a combination of different diameter segments are also explored. The spatial distribution of water molecules under confinement are diameter-dependent; however, proton solvation and transport is consistently found to occur in the water layer adjacent to the pore wall, showing an 'amphiphilic' character of the hydrated excess proton hydronium-like structure. The proton transport free energy barrier also decreases significantly as the nanopore diameter increases and proton transport becomes almost barrierless in the d > 1 nm nanopores. Among the nanopores studied, the Zundel cation (${H_{5}O_{2}}^{+}$) is populated only in the d = 0.95 nm CNT (7,7) nanopore. The presence of the hydrated excess proton and $K^{+}$ inside the CNT (7,7) nanopore induces a water density increase by 40 and 20%, respectively. The $K^{+}$ transport through CNT nanopores is also consistently higher in free energy barrier than proton transport. Interestingly, the evolution of excess protonic charge defect distribution reveals a 'frozen' single water wire configuration in the d = 0.81 nm CNT (6,6) nanopore (or segment), through which hydrated excess protons can only shuttle via the Grotthuss mechanism. Vehicular diffusion becomes relevant to proton transport in the 'flat' free energy regions and in the wider nanopores, where protons do not primarily shuttle in the axial direction.",

    "abstract": "Nanopores in 2D materials are of significant interest in advanced membrane technologies aimed at the sensing and separation of ions and molecules. These applications necessitate 2D nanopores that are precise in size and shape, and abundant in number. However, conventional fabrication techniques often struggle to achieve both high precision and throughput. In this study, we introduce a decoupled seeding and growth approach designed to overcome this limitation. The method allows the controlled fabrication of ensembles of nanopores with narrow size distribution and is demonstrated for free-standing monolayer hexagonal boron nitride. Using light ion showering, we first create vacancy defect seeds. These seeds are then expanded into triangular nanopores through element-specific preferential atom removal under broad-beam electron irradiation in a transmission electron microscope. Nanopore density and size are controlled by the ion and electron irradiation doses, respectively. During the electron irradiation step, high-resolution imaging allows real-time tracking of the nanopore formation process, enabling the highest level of control. An additional workflow is introduced using thermal annealing in air for the nanopore growth step, delivering the most flexible platform for nanopore fabrication over larger areas with the significant benefit of concurrently removing surface hydrocarbon contamination to mitigate pore clogging and distortion. This study provides researchers with a novel approach to create ensembles of meticulously designed nanopores with well-controlled size and geometry, facilitating the development of next-generation membrane devices that will demand high precision and high throughput nanopore fabrication pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Ultrathin nanopore membranes based on 2D materials have demonstrated ultimate resolution toward DNA sequencing. Among them, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) shows long-term stability as well as superior sensitivity enabling high throughput performance. The traditional method of fabricating nanopores with nanometer precision is based on the use of focused electron beams in transmission electron microscope (TEM). This nanopore fabrication process is time-consuming, expensive, not scalable and hard to control below 1 nm. Here, we exploited the electrochemical activity of MoS2 and developed a convenient and scalable method to controllably make nanopores in single-layer MoS2 with sub-nanometer precision using electrochemical reaction (ECR). The electrochemical reaction on the surface of single-layer MoS2 is initiated at the location of defects or single atom vacancy, followed by the successive removals of individual atoms or unit cells from single-layer MoS2 lattice and finally formation of a nanopore. Step-like features in the ionic current through the growing nanopore provide direct feedback on the nanopore size inferred from a widely used conductance vs. pore size model. Furthermore, DNA translocations can be detected in-situ when as-fabricated MoS2 nanopores are used. The atomic resolution and accessibility of this approach paves the way for mass production of nanopores in 2D membranes for potential solid-state nanopore sequencing.",

Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the mechanical behavior and thermal stability of two different bicontinuous nanoporous high entropy alloys, Al0.1CoCrFeNi and NbMoTaW. To isolate the properties related to the nanoporous nature of our samples, we also studied the corresponding bulk and nanocrystalline systems. The results demonstrate that the specific modulus of nanoporous HEAs are 2 to 3 times greater than that of single element nanoporous materials with specific strength reaching values 5 to 10 times higher, comparable to bulk metals with the highest specific strength. Bicontinuous HEAs also displayed excellent resistance to thermal degradation as evidenced by the absence of coarsening ligaments up to temperatures of 1273 K which ensures the durability and reliability in high-temperature applications. The findings uncover unprecedented mechanical and thermal properties of bicontinuous nanoporous high entropy alloys, paving the way for their promising utilization in advanced engineering and structural applications.",

The ligament size is usually considered as the only parameter controlling thermal stability and mechanical properties of nanoporous gold. Recently we developed a method for creating nanoporous single crystal gold particles using eutectic decomposition of Au-Ge, followed by selective etching of Ge. Here, we used this novel method to create nanoporous gold particles with controlled ligament sizes by changing the initial sample relative concentrations of gold and germanium. When investigated from 1 to 4 hour at 250 to 400 degrees C the material was thermally stable up to 350 degrees C, which is higher than the thermal stability of classical nanoporous gold with similar ligament sizes prepared by dealloying. Mechanical properties were examined utilizing nanoindentation of nanoporous gold before and after annealing. For smaller ligament sizes, hardness increases with annealing temperature up to 300 degrees C and then strongly decreases. For larger ligament sizes, hardness decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Young modulus was unchanged up to 300 degrees C.",

Here, we form nanocapillaries of zero depth by dissolving two superimposed and crossing metallic nanorods, thereby opening two overlapping nanofluidic channels molded in a polymeric resin. In an electrolyte, the interface shared by the crossing fluidic channels is mathematically of zero thickness and defines the narrowest constriction in the stream of ions through the nanopore device. This novel architecture provides the possibility to design nanopore fluidic channels, particularly with a robust 3D architecture maintaining the ultimate zero thickness geometry independently of the thickness of the fluidic channels. With orders of magnitude reduced biomolecule translocation speed, and lowered electronic and ionic noise compared to nanopores in 2D materials, our findings establish interfacial nanopores as a scalable platform for realizing nanofluidic systems, capable of single-molecule detection.",

Here, we still focus on nanoporous Au, addressing the long-standing issue of mechanical properties in nanoporous metals. In particular, we investigate how Young's modulus changes with ligament size, being the porosity the same. Based on atomistic replicas generated starting from experimental tomographic evidence, atomistic simulations reveal that nanoporous Au stiffens as ligaments become finer, reproducing experimental findings obtained by nanoindentation of dealloyed samples.

As the choice of Fermi energy is crucial for obtaining significant current rectification, explicit dependence of Fermi energy on the degree of current rectification is also studied for a particular shape of the nanopore.

The characterization of the pore morphology and size distribution, along with its dependence on the material properties and fabrication parameters, is crucial to designing nanopore systems for specific applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of track-etched nanopores in thermal and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) SiO$_{2}$ using synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We present a new approach for analyzing the complex highly anisotropic 2-dimensional SAXS patterns of the pores by reducing the analysis to two orthogonal 1-dimensional slices of the data. The simultaneous fit of the data enables an accurate determination of the pore geometry and size distribution. The analysis reveals substantial differences between the nanopores in thermal and PECVD SiO$_{2}$. The track-to-bulk etching rate ratio is significantly different for the two materials, producing nanopores with cone angles that differ by almost a factor of 2. Furthermore, thermal SiO$_2$ exhibits an exceptionally narrow size distribution of only ~2-4%, while PECVD SiO$_2$ shows a higher variation ranging from ~8-18%.

However, recent experiments have shown that salt concentration gradients applied across nanopores can also dramatically enhance charged particle capture from a low concentration reservoir of charged molecules at one end of the nanopore. This puzzling effect has hitherto eluded a physically consistent theoretical explanation. Here, we propose an electrokinetic mechanism of this enhanced capture that relies on the electrostatic potential near the pore mouth. For long pores with diameter much greater than the local screening length, we obtain accurate analytic expressions showing how salt gradients control the local conductivity which can lead to increased local electrostatic potentials and charged analyte capture rates. We also find that the attractive electrostatic potential may be balanced by an outward, repulsive electroosmotic flow (EOF) that can in certain cases conspire with the salt gradient to further enhance the analyte capture rate.",

Electrostatic interactions between charges in aqueous solution are a kind of strong long-range interaction which may have great influence on the fluid transport through nanopores. Here, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate ion and water transport through a 1.05-nm-in-diameter monolayer graphene nanopore with its edge charge-modified. From the results, it is found that the nanopores are selective to counterions when they are charged. As the charge amount increases, the total ionic currents show an increase-decrease profile while the co-ion currents monotonously decrease. The co-ions rejection can reach 75% and 90% when the nanopores are negatively and positively charged, respectively. Cl ions current increases and reaches a plateau, and Na+ current decreases with the charge amount in the systems where they act as counterions. Besides, the charge modification can enhance the water transport through nanopores obviously. This is mainly due to the ion selection of nanopores. Especially, positive charges on the pore edge facilitate the water transport much more than negative charges.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional nanomaterials, such as graphene, have been extensively studied because of their outstanding physical properties. Structure and geometry optimization of nanopores on such materials is beneficial for their performances in real-world engineering applications, like water desalination. However, the optimization process often involves very large number of experiments or simulations which are expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we propose a graphene nanopore optimization framework via the combination of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for efficient water desalination. The DRL agent controls the growth of nanopore by determining the atom to be removed at each timestep, while the CNN predicts the performance of nanoporus graphene for water desalination: the water flux and ion rejection at a certain external pressure. With the synchronous feedback from CNN-accelerated desalination performance prediction, our DRL agent can optimize the nanoporous graphene efficiently in an online manner. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on promising DRL-designed graphene nanopores show that they have higher water flux while maintaining rival ion rejection rate compared to the normal circular nanopores. Semi-oval shape with rough edges geometry of DRL-designed pores is found to be the key factor for their high water desalination performance. Ultimately, this study shows that DRL can be a powerful tool for material design.",

Molecular dynamics simulations show that the permeability do not increase with the inverse of the membrane thickness, violating the classical hydrodynamic behavior. The data also reveals that the water dynamics is slower than that observed in frictionless carbon nanotubes and multi-layer graphene membranes, which we explain in terms of an anchor mechanism observed in between layers. We show that the membrane permeability is critically dependent on the nanopore architecture, bringing important insights into the manufacture of new desalination membranes.",

An open-source multi-cpu and gpu-capable software is presented and used for the generation of computational samples. The stress strain curves show a non-linear elastic response, with early yielding. The plastic regime is first characterized by a linear hardening followed by an exponential hardening at large strains, associated with a high degree of densification. Plasticity is dominated by dislocation activity, with twinning and vacancy formation appearing as complementary deformation mechanisms. In order to study the mechanical response from a topological perspective, we track the evolution of the genus throughout the tests, finding direct correlations with each regime of the stress strain curves. The results are in agreement with previous studies of plasticity in nanoporous metals and highlight the importance of using topological metrics, for gaining insights into complex aspects of the deformation of nanoporous metals.",

    "abstract": "The applications of plasmonics to energy transfer from free-space radiation to molecules are currently limited to the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum due to the intrinsic optical properties of bulk noble metals that support strong electromagnetic field confinement only close to their plasma frequency in the visible/ultraviolet range. In this work, we show that nanoporous gold can be exploited as plasmonic material for the mid-infrared region to obtain strong electromagnetic field confinement, co-localized with target molecules into the nanopores and resonant with their vibrational frequency. The effective optical response of the nanoporous metal enables the penetration of optical fields deep into the nanopores, where molecules can be loaded thus achieving a more efficient light-matter coupling if compared to bulk gold. In order to realize plasmonic resonators made of nanoporous gold, we develop a nanofabrication method based on polymeric templates for metal deposition and we obtain antenna arrays resonating at mid-infrared wavelengths selected by design. We then coat the antennas with a thin (3 nm) silica layer acting as target dielectric layer for optical energy transfer. We study the strength of the light-matter coupling at the vibrational absorption frequency of silica at 1250 cm-1 through the analysis of the experimental Fano lineshape that is benchmarked against identical structures made of bulk gold. The boost of optical energy transfer from free-space mid-infrared radiation to molecular vibrations in nanoporous 3D nanoantenna arrays can open new application routes for plasmon-enhanced physical-chemical reactions.",

    "abstract": "Liquid transport through nanopore is central into many applications, from water purification to biosensing or energy harvesting. Ultimately thin nanopores are of major interest in these applications to increase driving potential and reduce as much as possible dissipation sources. We investigate here the efficiency of the electrical power generation through an ultrathin nanoporous membrane by means of streaming current (electrical current induced by ionic flow in the vicinity of the liquid/solid interface) or electroosmosis (flow rate induced by an electrical potential). Upscaling from one unique pore to a nanoporous membrane is not straightforward when we consider low aspect ratio nanopore because of 3D entrance effects, which lead to interactions between the pores. Whereas these interactions have already been considered for direct transport (hydrodynamic permeability of the membrane, ionic conductance), specific effects appear when coupled transports are considered. We obtain here the expression of the electroosmotic mobility for a nanoporous membrane including surface conduction, and by a numerical evaluation of our results, we show that (i) it depends mainly of the distance between the pores and (ii) it is sublinear with the number of pores. Varying the pore spatial organization (square, hexagonal, disordered structure) reveals that these transport properties are only dependent on one parameter, the porosity of the membrane (if other parameters such as membrane material/thickness are kept constant). Finally, when considering energy conversion yield, it is shown that increasing the number of pores is deleterious, and a nonmonotonic behavior with salt concentration is reported.",

    "abstract": "Plasmonic nanopores are extensively investigated as single molecules detectors. The main limitations in plasmonic nanopore technology are the too fast translocation velocity of the molecule through the pore and the consequent very short analysis times, as well as the possible instabilities due to local heating. The most interesting approach to control the translocation of molecules and enable longer acquisition times is represented by the ability to efficiently trap and tune the motion of nanoparticles that can be used to tag molecules. Here, we theoretically investigate the performance of a magneto-plasmonic nanopore prepared with a thin layer of cobalt sandwiched between two gold layers. A nanopore is then coupled with a translocating magnetic nanoparticle. By setting the magnetic configuration of the cobalt layer around the pore by an external magnetic field, it is possible to generate a nanoscale magnetic tweezer to trap the nanoparticle at a specific point. Considering a 10 nm magnetite nanoparticle we calculate a trapping force up to 28 pN, an order of magnitude above the force that can be obtained with standard optical or plasmonic trapping approaches. Moreover, the magnetic force pulls the nanoparticle in close contact with the plasmonic nanopore's wall, thus enabling the formation of a nanocavity enclosing a deeply sub-wavelength confined electromagnetic field with an average field intensity enhancement up to 230 at near-infrared wavelengths. The presented hybrid magneto-plasmonic system points towards a strategy to improve nanopore-based biosensors for single-molecule detection and potentially for analysis of various biomolecules.",

    "abstract": "Researchers are currently exploring nanoporous two-dimensional materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), as potential desalination membranes. Here, we study the effect of grain boundaries (GBs) and interfacial electrostatic interactions on the desalination performance of bicrystalline nanoporous hBN, using classical molecular dynamics simulations supported by quantum-mechanical density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We investigate three different nanoporous bicrystalline hBN configurations, with symmetric tilt GBs having misorientation angles of 13.2{\\deg}, 21.8{\\deg}, and 32.2{\\deg}. We find that grain boundaries alter the areas and shapes of nanopores in bicrystalline hBN, as compared to the nanopores in monocrystalline hBN. We observe that, although bicrystalline nanoporous hBN with a misorientation angle of 13.2{\\deg} shows improved water flow rate by ~30%, it demonstrates reduced Na$^\\mathrm{+}$ ion rejection by ~6%, as compared to monocrystalline hBN. We also uncover the role of the nanopore shape in water desalination, finding that more elongated pores with smaller sizes (in 21.8{\\deg}- and 32.2{\\deg}-misoriented bicrystalline hBN) can match the water permeation through less elongated pores of slightly larger sizes, with a concomitant ~3-4% drop in Na$^\\mathrm{+}$ rejection. Simulations also predict that the water flow rate is significantly affected by interfacial electrostatic interactions. Indeed, the water flow rate is the highest when altered partial charges on B and N atoms were determined using DFT calculations, as compared to when no partial charges or bulk partial charges (i.e., charged hBN) were considered. Overall, our work on water/ion transport through nanopores in bicrystalline hBN indicates that the presence of GBs and surface charge can lead, respectively, to a drop in the ion rejection and water permeation performance of hBN membranes.",

    "abstract": "Nanostructured materials exhibit low thermal conductivity because of the additional scattering due to phonon-boundary interactions. As these interactions are highly sensitive to the mean free path (MFP) of a given phonon mode, MFP distributions in nanostructures can be dramatically distorted relative to bulk. Here we calculate the MFP distribution in periodic nanoporous Si for different temperatures, using the recently developed MFP-dependent Boltzmann Transport Equation. After analyzing the relative contribution of each phonon branch to thermal transport in nanoporous Si, we find that at room temperature optical phonons contribute 18 % to heat transport, compared to 5% in bulk Si. Interestingly, we observe a steady thermal conductivity in the nanoporous materials over a temperature range 200 K < T < 300 K, which we attribute to the ballistic transport of acoustic phonons with long intrinsic MFP. These results, which are also consistent with a recent experimental study, shed light on the origin of the reduction of thermal conductivity in nanostructured materials, and could contribute to multiscale heat transport engineering, in which the bulk material and geometry are optimized concurrently.",

Using density functional theory and the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, we calculate the phonon-size effects and thermal conductivity of nanoporous silicon with different anisotropicpore lattices. Our calculations predict a strong directionality in the thermal conductivity, dictated by the difference in the pore-pore distances along the two Cartesian axes. As the space between pores along the direction of the applied temperature gradient represents the phonon bottleneck, an anisotropic pores lattice distortion induces directionality in heat transport. Using Fourier's law, we also compute diffusive heat transport for the same geometries obtaining significantly smaller anisotropicity, revealing the crucial role of phonon-size effects in tuning thermal transport directionality. Besides enhancing our understanding of nanoscale heat transport, our results demonstrate the promise of nanoporous materials for modulating anisotropy in thermal conductivity.",

For example, last two years the attempts to develop the fractionalized two-fluid hydrodynamics for nanoporous media with fractal dimensions have been made. The actuality of such new hydrodynamics becomes very clear for the last development in chemical synthesis of different kind of aerogels with nanopore structure as well as numerous studies of nanoporous substances. One of the interesting obtained results that density waves (the first sound) and temperature waves (the second sound) become strong coupled even in the absence of viscosity, so it is purely geometric effect of fractal space of nanopores.

Here we test the validity of Gassmann equation using two published sets of ultrasonic measurements for a model nanoporous medium, Vycor glass, saturated with two different fluids, argon and n-hexane. Predictions of the Gassmann theory depend on the bulk and shear moduli of the dry samples, which are known from ultrasonic measurements, and the bulk moduli of the solid and fluid constituents. The solid bulk modulus can be estimated from adsorption-induced deformation or from elastic effective medium theory. The fluid modulus can be calculated according to the Tait-Murnaghan equation at the solvation pressure in the pore.

    "abstract": "Here, we propose an easy and robust strategy for the versatile preparation of hybrid plasmonic nanopores by means of controlled deposition of single flakes of MoS2 directly on top of metallic holes. The device is realized on silicon nitride commercial membranes and can be further refined by TEM or FIB milling to achieve the passing of molecules or nanometric particles through a pore. Importantly, we show that the plasmonic enhancement provided by the nanohole is strongly accumulated in the 2D nanopore, thus representing an ideal system for single-molecule sensing and sequencing in a flow-through configuration. Here, we also demonstrate that the prepared 2D material can be decorated with metallic nanoparticles that can couple their resonance with the nanopore resonance to further enhance the electromagnetic field confinement at the nanoscale level. This method can be applied to any gold nanopore with a high level of reproducibility and parallelization; hence, it can pave the way to the next generation of solid-state nanopores with plasmonic functionalities. Moreover, the controlled/ordered integration of 2D materials on plasmonic nanostructures opens a pathway towards new investigation of the following: enhanced light emission; strong coupling from plasmonic hybrid structures; hot electron generation; and sensors in general based on 2D materials.

Both models yield a compliance, which is much higher than the predictions of the Gibson-Ashby scaling relation for metal foams and thus confirm the influence of other microstructural features besides the porosity. The linear elastic FEM simulation also yields a substantially stiffer response than the MD simulation, which reveals that nonlinear elastic behavior contributes decisively to the anomalous compliance of nanoporous gold at small structure size.",

This material possesses a particular structure with interconnected networks of high pore volume, producing membranes with a large surface area. Experiments revealed that PG combines remarkable properties such as high mechanical strength and good thermal stability. In this work, we have carried out fully-atomistic reactive (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations to perform a comprehensive study on the elastic properties, fracture mechanism, and thermal stability of 2D porous n-Benzo-CMPs (CMP and n refer, respectively, to pi-conjugated microporous polymers and the pore diameter) membranes with distinct nanoporous architectures. For comparison purposes, the results were also contrasted with the ones for graphene sheets of similar dimensions. We adopted three different nanoporous diameters: small (3.45 A), medium (8.07 A), and large (11.93 A). Results showed that PG is thermally stable up to 4660K, about 1000K smaller than the graphene melting point (5643K). During the PG heating, linear atomic chains are formed combining carbon and hydrogen atoms. The fracture strains range between 15%-34% by applying a uniaxial loading in both plane directions for temperatures up to 1200K. The fracture strain increases proportionally with the nanoporous size. Remarkably, the critical tensile strength for the PG complete fracture is temperature independent. Instead, it depends only on the nanoporous diameter. All the PG membranes go abruptly from elastic to completely fractured regimes after a critical strain threshold.",

    "abstract": "Nanoporous membranes have gained considerable interest in drug delivery1, ion transportation2, micro/nanofluidics3, molecular sensing4, and separation science5. Artificial kidneys, also known as dialyzers, reject pathogens and other unwanted substances from the blood, utilize hundreds of soft and nanoporous polymeric microtubes, and slowly become a burden to the environment with the growing number of dialysis patients worldwide. We demonstrate the fabrication of nanoporous conductive wires utilizing empty polysulfone microtubes collected from expired and unused artificial kidneys, also known as medical wastes. Injecting a fluidic, highly conductive, and room temperature liquid alloy (eutectic gallium indium-eGaIn$_6$, 75% Ga, 25% In) into microtubes of a twenty years old dialyzer, here, we have revealed a new class of nanoporous and conductive functional materials. These conductive fibers upcycle a medical waste, do not require expensive and conventional fabrication processes, and still provide the quintessential metal-oxide/metal framework due to the presence of the native surface oxide (i.e., Gallium Oxide, Ga2O3) of eGaIn at the nanoconfinement (i.e., nanopores) for nano/biosensing. We harnessed these new materials to sense and differentiate microliter volumes of deionized (DI) water, 1M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 95% ethanol (EtOH), leveraging their electrical signatures. This new class of soft nanomaterials has the potential to become the paradigm-shift platforms for the next-generation of biomedical, bioelectronics, nanoelectronics, and sensor devices.",

Interestingly, due to their high spatial resolution, nanopores can also identify tags on long polymers, making them an attractive option as the reading element for molecular information storage strategies. To fully leverage the compact and robust nature of solid-state nanopores, however, they will need to be packaged in a highly parallelized manner with on-chip electronic signal processing capabilities to rapidly and accurately handle the data generated. Additionally, the membrane itself must have specific physical, chemical, and electrical properties to ensure sufficient signal-to-noise ratios are achieved, with the traditional membrane material being SiNX . Unfortunately, the typical method of deposition, low-pressure vapour deposition, requires temperatures beyond the thermal budget of CMOS back-end-of-line integration processes, limiting the potential to generate an on-chip solution. To this end, we explore various lower-temperature deposition techniques that are BEOL-compatible to generate SiNx membranes for solid-state nanopore use, and successfully demonstrate the ability for these alternative methods to generate low-noise nanopores that are capable of performing single-molecule experiments.",

This latter can be exploited to achieve extremely high sensitivity to the environment conditions, hence realizing interesting sensors. Here we compare the sensitivity of a plasmonic resonators made of nanoporous gold with a similar structures made of bulk metal. The experimental test of the enhanced sensitivity was performed by depositing the same stoichiometric quantity of dielectric material onto the two considered structures. The result, also confirmed by the biosensing of a short peptide, can be ascribed to the better field confinement and enhancement in porous metal. This suggests an application of nanoporous 3D structures as sensor platform in the near-infrared with sensitivity over 4.000 nm/RIU.",

In this study, we investigate the hot electron transfer from nanoporous gold (npAu) in dependence of the structure size, utilizing both the nanoscale feature size and the interconnected nature of this material. We employ photoelectron injection from nanoporous gold into the electrolyte under UV illumination as a test electron transfer process. Nanoporous gold thin films with sub-10 nm initial ligament diameter are stepwise coarsened by potential cycles in a photoelectrochemical setup, thereby allowing us to precisely probe the influence of ligament diameter on the photocurrent response. The resulting ligament diameter variations are confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. As the ligament diameter increased from 8 to 16 nm, there was a corresponding decrease in quantum efficiency proportional to the inverse ligament diameter squared. Such dependency is expected for electrons excited by surface collisions. For the small ligament diameter of 10 nm we estimate an emission efficiency of excited 6sp electrons as 3.14%, reaching 23% for the surface excited electrons.",

The introduction of nanoscale porosity, even at modest levels, has been known to drastically reduce a materials thermal conductivity, in some cases even below its amorphous limit, thereby significantly increasing its thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT. The details of the important attributes that drive these large reductions, however, are not yet clear. In this work, we employ large-scale equilibrium molecular dynamics to perform an exhaustive atomistic-scale investigation of the effect of porosity on thermal transport in nanoporous bulk silicon. Thermal transport is computed for over 50 different geometries, spanning a large number of geometrical degrees of freedom, such as cylindrical pores and voids, different porosities, diameters, neck sizes, pore/void numbers, and surface-to-volume ratios, placed in ordered fashion, or fully disordered. We thus quantify and compare the most important parameters that determine the thermal conductivity reductions in nanoporous materials. Ultimately, we find that, even at the nanoscale, the effect of merely reducing the line-of-sight of phonons, i.e. the clear pathways that phonons can utilize during transport, plays the most crucial role in reducing the thermal conductivity in nanoporous materials, beyond other metrics such as porosity and surface/boundary scattering.",

Based on this quantum effect, we established a physisorption equation from the perspective of quantum mechanics to re-understand the basic principles of gas physisorption within nanopores. Energy level transition triggers gas physisorption, and non-uniform spatial distribution of energy-quantized molecules within nanopores dominates the gas physisorption behavior. The spatial distribution of gas molecules can be adjusted by temperature, pressure and potential energy field. This result contributes to understand and predict the physisorption behavior of CH4 and CO2 within nanoporous materials.",

The presented irradiation protocol enables designing ultrathin membranes with tunable porosity and pore dimension, along with spatial uniformity across large-area substrates. Fabricated nanoporous membranes were characterized using scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging and the observed nanopore geometries were analyzed through a pore-edge detection script.

As an example, membranes featuring angstrom-scale pores were investigated in terms of their emerging water and ion flow properties through extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.

To investigate the effect of nanoconfinement on water compressibility, we performed water sorption experiments on two nanoporous glass samples while concomitantly measuring the speed of longitudinal and shear ultrasonic waves in these samples. These measurements yield the longitudinal and shear moduli of the water laden nanoporous glass as a function of relative humidity that we utilized in the Gassmann theory to infer the bulk modulus of the confined water. This analysis shows that the bulk modulus (inverse of compressibility) of confined water is noticeably higher than that of the bulk water at the same temperature. Moreover, the modulus exhibits a linear dependence on the Laplace pressure. The results for water, which is a polar fluid, agree with previous experimental and numerical data reported for non-polar fluids. This similarity suggests that irrespective of intermolecular forces, confined fluids are stiffer than bulk fluids. Accounting for fluid stiffening in nanopores may be important for accurate interpretation of wave propagation measurements in fluid-filled nanoporous media, including in petrophysics, catalysis, and other applications, such as in porous materials characterization.",

Careful control of beam conditions allows us to nucleate and grow individual triangular and hexagonal pores with diameters ranging from subnanometer to 6nm over a large area of suspended hBN using a conventional TEM. These nanopores could find application in molecular sensing, DNA sequencing, water desalination, and molecular separation.

In this work, we identify an unusual anticorrelated specular phonon scattering effect which can result in additional reductions in thermal conductivity of up to ~ 80% for specific nanoporous geometries. We further find evidence that this effect has its origin in heat trapping between large pores with narrow necks. As the heat becomes trapped between the pores, phonons undergo multiple specular reflections such that their contribution to the thermal conductivity is partly undone. We find this effect to be wave-vector dependent at low temperatures. We use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, wave packet analysis, as well as an analytical model to illustrate the anticorrelation effect, evaluate its impact on thermal conductivity, and detail how it can be controlled to manipulate phonon transport in nanoporous materials.",

While fibrillar adhesive pads mimicking gecko feet are optimized for strong reversible adhesion, monolithic microsphere arrays mimicking the slippery zone of the pitchers of carnivorous plants of the genus Nepenthes show anti-adhesive properties even against tacky counterpart surfaces. In contrast to the influence of topography, the influence of relative humidity (RH) on adhesion has been widely neglected. Some previous works deal with the influence of RH on the adhesive performance of fibrillar adhesive pads. Commonly, humidity-induced softening of the fibrils enhances adhesion.

The aim of this study is thus to provide a yield criterion for nanoporous materials relevant for the coalescence regime, i.e. when plastic flow is localized between voids. Through homogenization and limit analysis, and accounting for interface stresses at the void-matrix interface, analytical coalescence criterion is derived under the following conditions: axisymmetric loading, orthotropic material obeying Hill's plasticity, cylindrical voids in cylindrical unit-cell. Incidentally, an orthotropic extension of the existing isotropic modeling of interface stresses through limit analysis is described and used. The proposed coalescence criterion is then extended to account for combined tension and shear loading conditions. Numerical limit analyses have been performed under specific conditions / materials parameters to get supposedly exact (up to numerical errors) results of coalescence stress. A good agreement between the analytical coalescence criteria derived in this study and numerical results is found for elongated spheroidal voids, making them usable to predict the onset of void coalescence in ductile fracture modeling of nanoporous materials.",

Since local charge current profiles in these GNRs are peaked around their edges, drilling nanopores in their interior does not affect such edge charge currents while drastically reducing heat current carried by phonons in sufficiently long wires. The combination of these two effects can yield highly efficient thermoelectric devices with maximum $ZT \\simeq 11$ at liquid nitrogen temperature and $ZT \\simeq 4$ at room temperature achieved in $\\sim 1$ $\\mu$m long zigzag GNRs with nanopores of variable diameter and spacing between them. Our analysis is based on the $\\pi$-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonian with up to third nearest-neighbor hopping for electronic subsystem, the empirical fourth-nearest-neighbor model for phononic subsystem, and nonequilibrium Green function formalism to study quantum transport in both of these models.",

    "title": "Switchable Imbibition in Nanoporous Gold",
    "abstract": "Spontaneous imbibition enables the elegant propelling of nano-flows because of the dominance of capillarity at small length scales. The imbibition kinetics are, however, solely determined by the static geometry of the porous host, the capillarity, and the fluidity of the imbibed liquid. This makes active control particularly challenging. Here, we show for aqueous electrolyte imbibition in nanoporous gold that the fluid flow can be reversibly switched on and off through electric potential control of the solid-liquid interfacial tension, i.e. we can accelerate the imbibition front, stop it, and have it proceed at will. Simultaneous measurements of the mass flux and the electrical current allow us to document simple scaling laws for the imbibition kinetics, and to explore the charge flow dynamics in the metallic nanopores. Our findings demonstrate that the high electric conductivity along with the pathways for ionic and/or fluid transport render nanoporous elemental gold a versatile, accurately controllable electro-capillary pump and flow sensor for minute amounts of liquids with exceptionally low operating voltages.",

    "abstract": "We experimentally explore pressure-driven flow of water and n-hexane across nanoporous silica (Vycor glass monoliths with 7 or 10 nm pore diameters, respectively) as a function of temperature and surface functionalization (native and silanized glass surfaces). Hydraulic flow rates are measured by applying hydrostatic pressures via inert gases (argon and helium, pressurized up to 70 bar) on the upstream side in a capacitor-based membrane permeability setup. For the native, hydrophilic silica walls, the measured hydraulic permeabilities can be quantitatively accounted for by bulk fluidity provided we assume a sticking boundary layer, i.e. a negative velocity slip length of molecular dimensions. The thickness of this boundary layer is discussed with regard to previous capillarity-driven flow experiments (spontaneous imbibition) and with regard to velocity slippage at the pore walls resulting from dissolved gas. Water flow across the silanized, hydrophobic nanopores is blocked up to a hydrostatic pressure of at least 70 bar. The absence of a sticking boundary layer quantitatively accounts for an enhanced n-hexane permeability in the hydrophobic compared to the hydrophilic nanopores.",

The obtained results show that GNRs junctions tend to open an energy gap when U-shaped structures were formed due to the formation of quasi-bound states at zigzag edges. The size of U shaped structures has enormous influences on the electron transport of the system. We also considered the effect of corner form of the U-shaped GNRs junctions on energy gap opening. It was found that as some carbon atoms are add to the inner corner, the energy gap in U shaped GNRs significantly changed. For patterned nanopores structured graphene, the calculated results show that patterned nanopores enormous influence on electronic and the transport properties though the GNRs junctions, depending on the shape, size, and the number of nanopores.

    "abstract": "Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (<20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.",

    "abstract": "Macroscopic strain experiments revealed that Si crystals traversed by parallel, channel-like nanopores functionalized with the muscle polymer polypyrrole exhibit large and reversible electrochemo-mechanical actuation in aqueous electrolytes. On the microscopical level this system still bears open questions, as to how the electrochemical expansion and contraction of PPy acts on to np-Si pore walls and how the collective motorics of the pore array emerges from the single-nanopore behavior. An analysis of in operando X-ray diffraction experiments with micromechanical finite element simulations, based on a 3D reconstruction of the nanoporous medium by TEM tomography, shows that the in-plane mechanical response is dominantly isotropic despite the anisotropic elasticity of the single crystalline host matrix. However, the structural anisotropy originating from the parallel alignment of the nanopores lead to significant differences between the in- and out-of-plane electromechanical response. This response is not describable by a simple 2D arrangement of parallel cylindrical channels. Rather, the simulations highlight that the dendritic shape of the Si pore walls, including pore connections between the main channels, cause complex, inhomogeneous stress-strain fields in the crystalline host. Time-dependent X-ray scattering on the dynamics of the actuator properties hint towards the importance of diffusion limitations, plastic deformation and creep in the nanoconfined polymer upon (counter-)ion adsorption and desorption, the very pore-scale processes causing the macroscopic electroactuation. From a more general perspective, our study demonstrates that the combination of TEM tomography-based micromechanical modeling with high-resolution X-ray scattering experiments provides a powerful approach for in operando analysis of nanoporous composites from the single-nanopore up to the porous-medium scale.",

By introducing a quantum capacitance that accounts for the density of states in the material, we show that ion-ion interactions in carbon nanotubes and graphene slit pores actually decay algebraically with ion separation. This result suggests a new avenue of capacitance optimization based on tuning the electronic structure of a pore: a marked enhancement in capacitance might be achieved by developing nanopores made with metallic materials or bulk semimetallic materials.",

In this paper we outline a semiclassical Monte Carlo code for the study of phonon transport and present an investigation of the thermal conductivity in nanoporous and nanocrystalline silicon. Different disordered geometry configurations are incorporated to investigate the effects of pores and grain boundaries on the phonon flux and the thermal conductivity, including the effects of boundary roughness, pore position and pore diameter. At constant porosity, thermal conductivity reduction is maximized by having a large number of smaller diameter pores as compared to a small number of larger diameter pores. Furthermore, we show that porosity has a greater impact on thermal conductivity than the degree of boundary roughness.

The resultant SiC monolayers seamlessly connect with the graphene lattice, forming a planar structure distinct by a wide direct bandgap.

This UHTC scaffold is synthesized via gas-phase carburization of nanoporous tantalum to the ultra-high-temperature ceramic, TaC. The kinetics of Ta conversion in a carburizing environment was examined over a range of temperatures to determine rate-limiting behavior and activation energy for the process. A 1-D moving interface model was constructed to predict carburization depth and compare data from the present work to that in the literature. It was found that the activation energy for carburization increases as conversion proceeds, suggesting a transition from grain boundary to bulk diffusion. Additionally, to simulate potential use cases of this nanoporous ceramic, the compositional and morphological stability was evaluated in a high temperature environment. Finally, the utility of this thermally stable porous UHTC was demonstrated through synthesis of a nanostructured composite of TaC and oxidation-resistant material, SiO2.",

That means that we may model the electric fields due to charge densities in the nanopore in terms of average properties across the nanopore as solutions of one dimensional Poisson equations. We develop basic equations for an M component system using equations of continuity to relate concentrations to currents, and flux equations relating currents to concentration gradients and conductivities. We then derive simplified scaled versions of the equations. We develop exact solutions for the one component case in a variety of boundary conditions using a Hopf-Cole transformation, Fourier series, and periodic solutions of the Burgers equation. These are compared with a simpler model in which the scaled diffusivity is zero so that all charge motion is driven by the electric field. In this non-dissipative case, recourse to an admissibility condition is utilised to obtain the physically relevant weak solution of a Riemann problem concerning the electric field. It is shown that the admissibility condition is Poynting's theorem.",

    "abstract": "Energy harvesting from evaporation has become a hot topic in the last couple of years. Researchers have speculated on several possible mechanisms. Electrokinetic energy conversion is the least hypothetical one. The basics of pressure-driven electrokinetic phenomena of streaming current and streaming potential have long been established. The regularities of evaporation from porous media are also well known. However, coupling of these two classes of phenomena has not, yet, been seriously explored. In this critical review, we will recapitalize and combine the available knowledge from these two fields to produce a coherent picture of electrokinetic electricity generation during evaporation from (nano)porous materials. For illustration, we will consider several configurations, namely, single nanopores, arrays of nanopores, systems with reduced area of electrokinetic-conversion elements and devices with side evaporation from thin nanoporous films. For the latter (practically the only one studied experimentally), we will formulate a simple model describing correlations of system performance with such principal parameters as the nanoporous-layer length, width and thickness as well as the pore size, pore-surface hydrophilicity, effective zeta-potential and electric conductivity in nanopores. These correlations will be qualitatively compared with experimental data available in the literature. We will see that experimental data not always are in agreement with the model predictions, which may be due to simplifying model assumptions but also because the mechanisms are different from the classical electrokinetic energy conversion. In particular, this concerns the mechanisms of conversion of evaporation-driven ion streaming currents into electron currents in external circuits. We will also formulate directions of future experimental and theoretical studies that could help clarify these issues.",

    "title": "Electric Properties of Dirac Fermions Captured into 3D Nanoporous Graphene Networks",
    "abstract": "Graphene, as a promising material of post-silicon electronics, opens a new paradigm for the novel electronic properties and device applications. On the other hand, the 2D feature of graphene makes it technically challenging to be integrated into 3D transistors with a sufficient processor capacity. Although there are many attempts to assemble 2D graphene into 3D structures, the characteristics of massless Dirac fermions cannot be well preserved in these materials for transistor applications. Here we report a high-performance graphene transistor by utilizing 3D nanoporous graphene which is comprised of an interconnected single graphene sheet and a commodious open porosity to infuse an ionic liquid for a tunable electronic state by applying electric fields. The 3D nanoporous graphene transistor, with high carrier mobility of 5000-7500 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, exhibits two to three orders of magnitude higher electric conductance and capacitance than those of 2D graphene devices, along with preserved ambipolor electronic nature of Dirac cones. Moreover, the 3D graphene networks with Dirac fermions turn out to exhibit a unique nonlinear Hall resistance in a wide range of the gate voltages. The high quality 3D nanoporous graphene EDLT may open a new field for utilizing Dirac fermions in 3D network structures for various fundamental and practical applications.",

    "title": "Wafer-Scale Electroactive Nanoporous Silicon: Large and Fully Reversible Electrochemo-Mechanical Actuation in Aqueous Electrolytes",
    "abstract": "Nanoporosity in silicon results in an interface-dominated mechanics, fluidics and photonics that are often superior to the ones of the bulk material. However, their active control, e.g. as a response to electronic stimuli, is challenging due to the absence of intrinsic piezoelectricity in the base material. Here, for large-scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers wetted by aqueous electrolytes, we show electrosorption-induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600 kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by electrical potential variations of approximately 1 V. Laser cantilever bending experiments in combination with in-operando cyclic voltammetry and step-coulombmetry allow us to quantitatively trace this large electro-actuation to the concerted action of 100 billions of parallel nanopores per square centimeter cross section and to determine the capacitive charge-stress coupling parameter upon ion ad- and desorption as well as the intimately related stress actuation dynamics for perchloric and isotonic saline solutions. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity (electrostatic Hellmann-Feynman interactions) with respect to the importance of oxide formation and pore-wall roughness on the single-nanopore scale. The observation of robust electrochemo-mechanical actuation in a mainstream semiconductor with wafer-scale, self-organized nanoporosity opens up entirely novel opportunities for on-chip integrated stress generation and actuorics at exceptionally low operation voltages.",

    "abstract": "Nanoporous materials have attracted significant interest as an emerging platform for adsorption-related applications. The high-throughput computational screening became a standard technique to access the performance of thousands of candidates, but its accuracy is highly dependent on a partial charge assignment method. In this study, we propose a machine learning model that can reconcile the benefits of two main approaches-the high accuracy of density-derived electrostatic and chemical charge (DDEC) method and the scalability of charge equilibration (Qeq) method. The mean absolute deviation of predicted partial charges from the original DDEC counterparts archive an excellent level of 0.01e. The model, initially designed for metal-organic frameworks, is also capable of assigning charges to another class of nanoporous materials, covalent organic frameworks, with acceptable accuracy. Adsorption properties of carbon dioxide, calculated by means of machine learning derived charges, are consistent with the reference data obtained with DDEC charges.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning technologies have demonstrated immense capabilities in various domains. They play a key role in the success of modern businesses. However, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched potential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve unique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of machine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature prevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of efficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development. In this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and discuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major solution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We analyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning solutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two image based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning solutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering advantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way the monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the use of machine learning in meteorology has increased greatly. While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to perception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their every day workflow. To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy towards machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning methods are demonstrated: linear regression; logistic regression; decision trees; random forest; gradient boosted decision trees; naive Bayes; and support vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets. Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to catalyse the use of machine learning in meteorology.",

    "abstract": "Traditional machine learning algorithms use data from databases that are mutable, and therefore the data cannot be fully trusted. Also, the machine learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.",

Machine learning clouds hold the promise of hiding all the sophistication of running large-scale machine learning: Instead of specifying how to run a machine learning task, users only specify what machine learning task to run and the cloud figures out the rest. Raising the level of abstraction, however, rarely comes free - a performance penalty is possible. How good, then, are current machine learning clouds on real-world machine learning workloads? We study this question with a focus on binary classication problems. We present mlbench, a novel benchmark constructed by harvesting datasets from Kaggle competitions. We then compare the performance of the top winning code available from Kaggle with that of running machine learning clouds from both Azure and Amazon on mlbench. Our comparative study reveals the strength and weakness of existing machine learning clouds and points out potential future directions for improvement.",

Data is critical and penetrating in the whole machine learning pipelines. As machine learning pipelines involve many parties and, in order to be successful, have to form a constructive and dynamic eco-system, marketplaces and data pricing are fundamental in connecting and facilitating those many parties. In this article, we survey the principles and the latest research development of data pricing in machine learning pipelines. We start with a brief review of data marketplaces and pricing desiderata. Then, we focus on pricing in three important steps in machine learning pipelines. To understand pricing in the step of training data collection, we review pricing raw data sets and data labels.

Meanwhile, privacy has emerged as a big concern in this machine learning-based artificial intelligence era. It is important to note that the problem of privacy preservation in the context of machine learning is quite different from that in traditional data privacy protection, as machine learning can act as both friend and foe. Currently, the work on the preservation of privacy and machine learning (ML) is still in an infancy stage, as most existing solutions only focus on privacy problems during the machine learning process. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the privacy preservation problems and machine learning is required. This paper surveys the state of the art in privacy issues and solutions for machine learning. The survey covers three categories of interactions between privacy and machine learning: (i) private machine learning, (ii) machine learning aided privacy protection, and (iii) machine learning-based privacy attack and corresponding protection schemes. The current research progress in each category is reviewed and the key challenges are identified.

Project organizations and machine learning practitioners have a need for guidance throughout the life cycle of a machine learning application to meet business expectations. We therefore propose a process model for the development of machine learning applications, that covers six phases from defining the scope to maintaining the deployed machine learning application. The first phase combines business and data understanding as data availability oftentimes affects the feasibility of the project. The sixth phase covers state-of-the-art approaches for monitoring and maintenance of a machine learning applications, as the risk of model degradation in a changing environment is eminent. With each task of the process, we propose quality assurance methodology that is suitable to adress challenges in machine learning development that we identify in form of risks.

In many cases, more than two maps are strongly related, so it is wise to make multiplicative unit learn relations among more input maps, in other words, to find the optimal relational-order of each unit. In order to enable our machine to learn relational order, we developed a reinforcement-learning method whose optimality is proven to train the network.",

In the context of science, scientific machine learning focuses on training machines to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies to extract meaningful scientific insights from such datasets. With a new generation of experimental facilities, the rate of data generation and the scale of data volumes will increasingly require the use of more automated data analysis. At present, identifying the most appropriate machine learning algorithm for the analysis of any given scientific dataset is still a challenge for scientists. This is due to many different machine learning frameworks, computer architectures, and machine learning models. Historically, for modelling and simulation on HPC systems such problems have been addressed through benchmarking computer applications, algorithms, and architectures. Extending such a benchmarking approach and identifying metrics for the application of machine learning methods to scientific datasets is a new challenge for both scientists and computer scientists.

    "abstract": "In-database machine learning has been very popular, almost being a cliche. However, can we do it the other way around? In this work, we say 'yes' by applying plain old SQL to deep learning, in a sense implementing deep learning algorithms with SQL. Most deep learning frameworks, as well as generic machine learning ones, share a de facto standard of multidimensional array operations, underneath fancier infrastructure such as automatic differentiation. As SQL tables can be regarded as generalisations of (multi-dimensional) arrays, we have found a way to express common deep learning operations in SQL, encouraging a different way of thinking and thus potentially novel models. In particular, one of the latest trend in deep learning was the introduction of sparsity in the name of graph convolutional networks, whereas we take sparsity almost for granted in the database world. As both databases and machine learning involve transformation of datasets, we hope this work can inspire further works utilizing the large body of existing wisdom, algorithms and technologies in the database field to advance the state of the art in machine learning, rather than merely integerating machine learning into databases.",

    "title": "Machine Learning Interpretability: A Science rather than a tool",
    "abstract": "The term 'interpretability' is oftenly used by machine learning researchers each with their own intuitive understanding of it. There is no universal well agreed upon definition of interpretability in machine learning. As any type of science discipline is mainly driven by the set of formulated questions rather than by different tools in that discipline, e.g. astrophysics is the discipline that learns the composition of stars, not as the discipline that use the spectroscopes. Similarly, we propose that machine learning interpretability should be a discipline that answers specific questions related to interpretability. These questions can be of statistical, causal and counterfactual nature. Therefore, there is a need to look into the interpretability problem of machine learning in the context of questions that need to be addressed rather than different tools. We discuss about a hypothetical interpretability framework driven by a question based scientific approach rather than some specific machine learning model. Using a question based notion of interpretability, we can step towards understanding the science of machine learning rather than its engineering. This notion will also help us understanding any specific problem more in depth rather than relying solely on machine learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning on graphs has been extensively studied in both academic and industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. To solve this critical challenge, automated machine learning (AutoML) on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine learning and AutoML together, is gaining attention from the research community. Therefore, we comprehensively survey AutoML on graphs in this paper, primarily focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning. We further overview libraries related to automated graph machine learning and in-depth discuss AutoGL, the first dedicated open-source library for AutoML on graphs. In the end, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning. This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive review of automated machine learning on graphs to the best of our knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The ethics of Machine Learning has become an unavoidable topic in the AI Community. The deployment of machine learning systems in multiple social contexts has resulted in a closer ethical scrutiny of the design, development, and application of these systems. The AI/ML community has come to terms with the imperative to think about the ethical implications of machine learning, not only as a product but also as a practice (Birhane, 2021; Shen et al. 2021). The critical question that is troubling many debates is what can constitute an ethically accountable machine learning system. In this paper we explore possibilities for ethical evaluation of machine learning methodologies. We scrutinize techniques, methods and technical practices in machine learning from a relational ethics perspective, taking into consideration how machine learning systems are part of the world and how they relate to different forms of agency. Taking a page from Phil Agre (1997) we use the notion of a critical technical practice as a means of analysis of machine learning approaches. Our radical proposal is that supervised learning appears to be the only machine learning method that is ethically defensible.",

We develop three algorithms for solving this problem: (1) the PTAP algorithm, which transforms a set of input-output traces into an incomplete Moore machine and then completes the machine with self-loops; (2) the PRPNI algorithm, which uses the well-known RPNI algorithm for automata learning to learn a product of automata encoding a Moore machine; and (3) the MooreMI algorithm, which directly learns a Moore machine using PTAP extended with state merging. We prove that MooreMI has the fundamental identification in the limit property. We also compare the algorithms experimentally in terms of the size of the learned machine and several notions of accuracy, introduced in this paper. Finally, we compare with OSTIA, an algorithm that learns a more general class of transducers, and find that OSTIA generally does not learn a Moore machine, even when fed with a characteristic sample.",

Possibly, one of the most relevant concerns is the assessment of our confidence in trusting machine learning predictions. In many real-world cases, it is of utmost importance to estimate the capabilities of a machine learning algorithm to generalize, i.e., to provide accurate predictions on unseen data, depending on the characteristics of the target problem. In this work, we perform a meta-analysis of 109 publicly-available classification data sets, modeling machine learning generalization as a function of a variety of data set characteristics, ranging from number of samples to intrinsic dimensionality, from class-wise feature skewness to $F1$ evaluated on test samples falling outside the convex hull of the training set. Experimental results demonstrate the relevance of using the concept of the convex hull of the training data in assessing machine learning generalization, by emphasizing the difference between interpolated and extrapolated predictions. Besides several predictable correlations, we observe unexpectedly weak associations between the generalization ability of machine learning models and all metrics related to dimensionality, thus challenging the common assumption that the \\textit{curse of dimensionality} might impair generalization in machine learning.",

Similar studies have helped in other security fields to discover root causes or improve risk communication. Our study reveals two \\facets of practitioners' mental models of machine learning security. Firstly, practitioners often confuse machine learning security with threats and defences that are not directly related to machine learning. Secondly, in contrast to most academic research, our participants perceive security of machine learning as not solely related to individual models, but rather in the context of entire workflows that consist of multiple components. Jointly with our additional findings, these two facets provide a foundation to substantiate mental models for machine learning security and have implications for the integration of adversarial machine learning into corporate workflows, \\new{decreasing practitioners' reported uncertainty}, and appropriate regulatory frameworks for machine learning security.",

These techniques aim to show how machine learning models function by providing either model centric local or global explanations, which can be based on mechanistic interpretations revealing the inner working mechanisms of models or nonmechanistic approximations showing input feature output data relationships. In this paper, we draw on social philosophy to argue that interpreting machine learning outputs in certain normatively salient domains could require appealing to a third type of explanation that we call sociostructural explanation. The relevance of this explanation type is motivated by the fact that machine learning models are not isolated entities but are embedded within and shaped by social structures. Sociostructural explanations aim to illustrate how social structures contribute to and partially explain the outputs of machine learning models. We demonstrate the importance of sociostructural explanations by examining a racially biased healthcare allocation algorithm. Our proposal highlights the need for transparency beyond model interpretability, understanding the outputs of machine learning systems could require a broader analysis that extends beyond the understanding of the machine learning model itself.",

Towards this primary problem within the four levels, I briefly review the existing studies about the connection between information theoretical learning (ITL [1]) and machine learning. A theorem is given on the relation between the empirically-defined similarity measure and information measures.

    "abstract": "Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication, computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of interconnected quantum computers, i.e., distributed quantum computing (DQC), multiple quantum computers can now collaborate via quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However, DQC faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics, quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks. However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on stochastic programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum resources. Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to handle the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing power, and fidelity in quantum networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and ability of the proposed scheme to balance the utilization of quantum computers and on-demand quantum computers while minimizing the overall cost of provisioning under uncertainty.",

It changes how such problems are approached and is not constrained by some of the classic computational complexity. Studies have shown that quantum computing can offer significant advantages over classical computing in many fields. The application of quantum computing has been constrained by the unavailability of actual quantum computers. In the past decade, there has been the rapid development of the large-scale quantum computer. However, software development for quantum computing is slow in many fields. In our study, we apply quantum computing to a multi-asset portfolio simulation. The simulation is based on historic data, covariance, and expected returns, all calculated using quantum computing.

In continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by properties of the electromagnetic field that take on any value in an interval (e.g. position). The electromagnetic field is transformed via Gaussian and non-Gaussian operations, and then detected via homodyne detection.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has seen tremendous progress in the past years. However, due to limitations in scalability of quantum technologies, it seems that we are far from constructing universal quantum computers for everyday users. A more feasible solution is the delegation of computation to powerful quantum servers on the network. This solution was proposed in previous studies of Blind Quantum Computation, with guarantees for both the secrecy of the input and of the computation being performed. In this work, we further develop this idea of computing over encrypted data, to propose a multiparty delegated quantum computing protocol in the measurement-based quantum computing framework.",

    "title": "What is a quantum computer, and how do we build one?",
    "abstract": "The DiVincenzo criteria for implementing a quantum computer have been seminal in focussing both experimental and theoretical research in quantum information processing. These criteria were formulated specifically for the circuit model of quantum computing. However, several new models for quantum computing (paradigms) have been proposed that do not seem to fit the criteria well. The question is therefore what are the general criteria for implementing quantum computers. To this end, a formal operational definition of a quantum computer is introduced. It is then shown that according to this definition a device is a quantum computer if it obeys the following four criteria: Any quantum computer must (1) have a quantum memory; (2) facilitate a controlled quantum evolution of the quantum memory; (3) include a method for cooling the quantum memory; and (4) provide a readout mechanism for subsets of the quantum memory. The criteria are met when the device is scalable and operates fault-tolerantly. We discuss various existing quantum computing paradigms, and how they fit within this framework. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for selecting an avenue towards building a quantum computer. This is summarized in a decision tree intended to help experimentalists determine the most natural paradigm given a particular physical implementation.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of quantum computing technology has led to the emergence of early-stage quantum cloud computing services. To fully realize the potential of quantum cloud computing, it is essential to develop techniques that ensure the privacy of both data and functions. Quantum computations often leverage superposition to evaluate a function on all possible inputs simultaneously, making function privacy a critical requirement. In 2009, Broadbent et al. introduced the Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC) protocol, which is based on Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) and provides a framework for ensuring both function and data privacy in quantum computing. Although theoretical results indicate an equivalence between MBQC and circuitbased quantum computation, translating MBQC into circuitbased implementations remains challenging due to higher qubit requirements and the complexity of the transformation process. Consequently, current quantum cloud computing platforms are limited in their ability to simulate MBQC efficiently. This paper presents an efficient method to simulate MBQC on circuit-based quantum computing platforms. We validate this approach by implementing the two-qubit Grover algorithm in the MBQC framework and further demonstrate blindness by applying the UBQC protocol. This work verifies the simulation of a blind quantum computation using the two-qubit Grover algorithm on a circuit-based quantum computing platform.",

    "abstract": "The standard generic quantum computer model is studied analytically and numerically and the border for emergence of quantum chaos, induced by imperfections and residual inter-qubit couplings, is determined. This phenomenon appears in an isolated quantum computer without any external decoherence. The onset of quantum chaos leads to quantum computer hardware melting, strong quantum entropy growth and destruction of computer operability. The time scales for development of quantum chaos and ergodicity are determined. In spite the fact that this phenomenon is rather dangerous for quantum computing it is shown that the quantum chaos border for inter-qubit coupling is exponentially larger than the energy level spacing between quantum computer eigenstates and drops only linearly with the number of qubits n. As a result the ideal multi-qubit structure of the computer remains rather robust against imperfections. This opens a broad parameter region for a possible realization of quantum computer. The obtained results are related to the recent studies of quantum chaos in such many-body systems as nuclei, complex atoms and molecules, finite Fermi systems and quantum spin glass shards which are also reviewed in the paper.",

As its quantum counterpart, the quantum walk is proposed as an important theoretical model for quantum computing. By exploiting the quantum effects such as superposition, interference and entanglement, quantum walks and their variety have been extensively studied for achieving beyond classical computing power, and they have been broadly used in designing quantum algorithms in fields ranging from algebraic and optimization problems, graph and network analysis, to quantum Hamiltonian and biochemical process simulations, and even further quantum walk models have proven their capabilities for universal quantum computation. Compared to the conventional quantum circuit models, quantum walks show a feasible path for implementing application-specific quantum computing in particularly the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Recently remarkable progress has been achieved in implementing a wide variety of quantum walks and quantum walk applications, demonstrating the great potential of quantum walks.

Cluster state quantum computing (recently proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel) is a new paradigm in quantum information processing and is a departure from the conventional model of quantum computation. The cluster state quantum computer begins by creating a highly entangled multi-particle state (the cluster state) which it uses as a quantum resource during the computation. Information is processed in the computer via selected measurements on individual qubits that form the cluster state. We describe in detail how a scalable quantum computer can be constructed using microwave cavity QED and, in a departure from the traditional understanding of a computer as a fixed array of computational elements, we show that cluster state quantum computing is well suited to atomic beam experiments. We show that all of the necessary elements have been individually realised, and that the construction of a truly scalable atomic beam quantum computer may be an experimental reality in the near future.",

From this development, a finite but approximate quantum universal family of observables is exhibited, which includes only one two-qubit observable, while others are one-qubit observables. In this article, an infinite but exact quantum universal family of observables is proposed, including also only one two-qubit observable.

The latter is called the measurement-only verifiable blind quantum computing. If the input of the client's quantum computing is a quantum state whose classical efficient description is not known to the client, there was no way for the measurement-only client to verify the correctness of the input.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the concept of symplectic computers, which have the potential to be more powerful than quantum computers. Unlike quantum computing, which consists of a sequence of unitary transformations (gates) and projectors (measurements), symplectic computation involves a sequence of symplectic transformations and measurements. The proposal to explore symplectic computers is based on the following quantum-symplectic duality. The Schr\\'odinger equation in its standard complex form describes the unitary evolution of a quantum system, while its real form describes the symplectic evolution of a classical mechanical system. This quantum-symplectic duality can be leveraged to enhance the capabilities of quantum and symplectic computers. In this symplectic approach, the role of a quantum bit (qubit) is taken by a symplectic bit (symbit).",

The $O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ bound on quantum computational complexity is also superior compared to those in the earlier approaches due to smaller constants.

Topological quantum computers use particles with exotic exchange statistics called non-Abelian anyons, and the simplest anyon model which allows for universal quantum computation by particle exchange or braiding alone is the Fibonacci anyon model. One classically hard problem that can be solved efficiently using quantum computation is finding the value of the Jones polynomial of knots at roots of unity. We aim to provide a pedagogical, self-contained, review of topological quantum computation with Fibonacci anyons, from the braiding statistics and matrices to the layout of such a computer and the compiling of braids to perform specific operations. Then we use a simulation of a topological quantum computer to explicitly demonstrate a quantum computation using Fibonacci anyons, evaluating the Jones polynomial of a selection of simple knots. In addition to simulating a modular circuit-style quantum algorithm, we also show how the magnitude of the Jones polynomial at specific points could be obtained exactly using Fibonacci or Ising anyons.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is gaining popularity across a wide range of scientific disciplines due to its potential to solve long-standing computational problems that are considered intractable with classical computers. One promising area where quantum computing has potential is in the speed-up of NP-hard optimisation problems that are common in industrial areas such as logistics and finance. Newcomers to the field of quantum computing who are interested in using this technology to solve optimisation problems do not have an easily accessible source of information on the current capabilities of quantum computers and algorithms. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theory of quantum optimisation techniques and their practical application, focusing on their near-term potential for noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. Two main paradigms for quantum hardware are then discussed: quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing. While quantum annealers are effective for some optimisation problems, they have limitations and cannot be used for universal quantum computation. In contrast, gate-based quantum computers offer the potential for universal quantum computation, but they face challenges with hardware limitations and accurate gate implementation. The paper provides a detailed mathematical discussion with references to key works in the field, as well as a more practical discussion with relevant examples. The most popular techniques for quantum optimisation on gate-based quantum computers, the quantum approximate optimisation (QAO) algorithm and the quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) framework, are discussed in detail. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges facing quantum optimisation techniques and the need for further research and development to identify new, effective methods for achieving quantum advantage.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computation is a promising emerging technology, and by utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics, it is expected to achieve faster computations than classical computers for specific problems. There are two distinct architectures for quantum computation: gate-based quantum computers and quantum annealing. In gate-based quantum computation, we implement a sequence of quantum gates that manipulate qubits. This approach allows us to perform universal quantum computation, yet they pose significant experimental challenges for large-scale integration. On the other hand, with quantum annealing, the solution of the optimization problem can be obtained by preparing the ground state. Conventional quantum annealing devices with transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, such as those manufactured by D-Wave Inc., achieving around 5000 qubits, are relatively more amenable to large-scale integration but are limited to specific computations. In this paper, we present a practical method for implementing universal quantum computation within the conventional quantum annealing architecture using the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian. Our innovative approach relies on an adiabatic transformation of the Hamiltonian, changing from transverse fields to a ferromagnetic interaction regime, where the ground states become degenerate. Notably, our proposal is compatible with D-Wave devices, opening up possibilities for realizing large-scale gate-based quantum computers. This research bridges the gap between conventional quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computation, offering a promising path toward the development of scalable quantum computing platforms.",

Here we present the first experimental verification of quantum computations. We show, in theory and in experiment, how a verifier with minimal quantum resources can test a significantly more powerful quantum computer. The new verification protocol introduced in this work utilizes the framework of blind quantum computing and is independent of the experimental quantum-computation platform used.

The protocol uses a quantum walk as a quantum control signal to perform distributed quantum operations. We consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined quantum walk model that accounts for the interaction between a quantum walker system in the network graph with quantum registers inside the network nodes. The protocol logically captures distributed quantum computing, abstracting hardware implementation and the transmission of quantum information through channels. Control signal transmission is mapped to the propagation of the walker system across the network, while interactions between the control layer and the quantum registers are embedded into the application of coin operators. We demonstrate how to use the quantum walker system to perform a distributed CNOT operation, which shows the universality of the protocol for distributed quantum computing.

    "abstract": "It is shown in the paper that the unitary quantum dynamics in quantum mechanics is the universal quantum driving force to speed up a quantum computation. This assertion supports strongly in theory that the unitary quantum dynamics is the fundamental and universal principle in nature. On the other hand, the symmetric structure of Hilbert space of a composite quantum system is the quantum-computing resource that is not owned by classical computation. A new quantum-computing speedup theory is set up on the basis of the unitary quantum dynamics. Both the unitary quantum dynamics and the symmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space of the quantum system are mainly responsible for an exponential quantum-computing speedup for a general efficient quantum algorithm. The inherent importance for the unitary quantum dynamics to speed up a quantum computation lies in the unique ability of the unitary quantum dynamics to build the effective interaction between the symmetric structure of the Hilbert space of the quantum system and the mathematical symmetric structure of a problem to be solved on the quantum system. This unique ability could result in an essential difference of computational power between quantum and classical computations by combining the symmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space. The new quantum-computing speedup theory also provides reasonable mechanisms for exponential quantum-computing speedup for the existing efficient quantum algorithms based on the quantum parallel principle. These existing quantum algorithms including the hidden-subgroup-problem quantum algorithms and conventional quantum search algorithms have the common character that the symmetric structure of the Hilbert space does not have any effective effect on these quantum algorithms. This could be the main reason why these quantum algorithms are quite special and considered to be semiclassical.",

Simply put it, a duality computer is a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer offers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming out of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show that an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary. A $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical computer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical computer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing and quantum computing.

This universal paradigm is known as digital-analog quantum computing. Here, we introduce an efficient digital-analog quantum algorithm to compute the quantum Fourier transform, a subroutine widely employed in several relevant quantum algorithms. We show that, under reasonable assumptions about noise models, the fidelity of the quantum Fourier transformation improves considerably using this approach when the number of qubits involved grows.

Besides the optimization of the physical layout of the hardware layer, the quantum computer should also solve difficult computational problems very efficiently. To yield a desired output system, a particular objective function associated with the computational problem fed into the quantum computer should be maximized. The reduced gate structure should be able to produce the maximized value of the objective function.

    "abstract": "Decomposition of biomolecular reaction networks into pathways is a powerful approach to the analysis of metabolic and signalling networks. Current approaches based on analysis of the stoichiometric matrix reveal information about steady-state mass flows (reaction rates) through the network. In this work we show how pathway analysis of biomolecular networks can be extended using an energy-based approach to provide information about energy flows through the network. This energy-based approach is developed using the engineering-inspired bond graph methodology to represent biomolecular reaction networks. The approach is introduced using glycolysis as an exemplar; and is then applied to analyse the efficiency of free energy transduction in a biomolecular cycle model of a transporter protein (Sodium-Glucose Transport Protein 1, SGLT1). The overall aim of our work is to present a framework for modelling and analysis of biomolecular reactions and processes which considers energy flows and losses as well as mass transport.",

It was shown that the resonant frequency shift of a resonator due to biomolecular adsorption depends on not only the mass of adsorbed biomolecules but also the biomolecular interactions. Specifically, for dsDNA adsorption on a resonator's surface, the resonant frequency shift is also dependent on the ionic strength of a solvent, implying the role of molecular interactions on the dynamic behavior of a resonator. This indicates that nanomechanical resonators may enable one to quantify the biomolecular mass, implying the enumeration of biomolecules, as well as gain insight into intermolecular interactions between adsorbed biomolecules on the surface.",

For a biomolecular oscillator, the overall constraints in how tuning of amplitude affects period, and vice versa, are generally unclear. Here we investigate this co-variation of the period and amplitude in mathematical models of biomolecular oscillators using both simulations and analytical approximations. We computed the amplitude-period co-variation of eleven benchmark biomolecular oscillators as their parameters were individually varied around a nominal value, classifying the various co-variation patterns such as a simultaneous increase/ decrease in period and amplitude. Next, we repeated the classification using a power norm-based amplitude metric, to account for the amplitudes of the many biomolecular species that may be part of the oscillations, finding largely similar trends. Finally, we calculate 'scaling laws' of period-amplitude co-variation for a subset of these benchmark oscillators finding that as the approximated period increases, the upper bound of the amplitude increases, or reaches a constant value. Based on these results, we discuss the effect of different parameters on the type of period-amplitude co-variation as well as the difficulty in achieving an oscillation with large amplitude and small period.",

This review covers recent advances in the prediction and computational design of biomolecular mixtures that phase-separate into many coexisting phases. First, we review efforts to understand the phase behavior of mixtures with hundreds or thousands of species using theoretical models and statistical approaches. We then describe progress in developing analytical theories and coarse-grained simulation models to predict multiphase condensates with the molecular detail required to make contact with biophysical experiments.

    "abstract": "Biomolecular computers, along with quantum computers, may be a future alternative for traditional, silicon-based computers. Main advantages of biomolecular computers are massive parallel processing of data, expanded capacity of storing information and compatibility with living organisms (first attempts of using biomolecular computers in cancer therapy through blocking of improper genetic information are described in Benenson et al.(2004). However, biomolecular computers have several drawbacks including time-consuming procedures of preparing of input, problems in detecting output signals and interference with by-products. Due to these obstacles, there are few laboratory implementations of theoretically designed DNA computers (like the Turing machine and pushdown automaton), but there are many implementations of DNA computers for particular problems. The first practical laboratory implementation of the general theoretical model of a machine performing DNA-based calculations was a simple two-symbol two-state finite automaton established by Benenson et al.(2001). In the present work, we propose a new attitude, extending the capability of DNA-based finite automaton, by employing two or potentially more restriction enzymes instead of one used in other works. This creates an opportunity to implement in laboratories of more complex finite automata and other theoretical models of computers: pushdown automata, Turing machines.",

On the one hand, geometric modeling provides molecular surface and structural representation, and offers the basis for molecular visualization, which is crucial for the understanding of molecular structure and interactions. On the other hand, it bridges the gap between molecular structural data and theoretical/mathematical models. Topological analysis and modeling give rise to atomic critical points and connectivity, and shed light on the intrinsic topological invariants such as independent components (atoms), rings (pockets) and cavities. Graph theory analyzes biomolecular interactions and reveals biomolecular structure-function relationship. In this paper, we review certain geometric, topological and graph theory apparatuses for biomolecular data modeling and analysis. These apparatuses are categorized into discrete and continuous ones. For discrete approaches, graph theory, Gaussian network model, anisotropic network model, normal mode analysis, quasi-harmonic analysis, flexibility and rigidity index, molecular nonlinear dynamics, spectral graph theory, and persistent homology are discussed. For continuous mathematical tools, we present discrete to continuum mapping, high dimensional persistent homology, biomolecular geometric modeling, differential geometry theory of surfaces, curvature evaluation, variational derivation of minimal molecular surfaces, atoms in molecule theory and quantum chemical topology.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a multiscale virtual particle based elastic network model (MVP-ENM) is proposed for biomolecular normal mode analysis. The multiscale virtual particle model is proposed for the discretization of biomolecular density data in different scales. Essentially, the model works as the coarse-graining of the biomolecular structure, so that a delicate balance between biomolecular geometric representation and computational cost can be achieved. To form 'connections' between these multiscale virtual particles, a new harmonic potential function, which considers the influence from both mass distributions and distance relations, is adopted between any two virtual particles. Unlike the previous ENMs that use a constant spring constant, a particle-dependent spring parameter is used in MVP-ENM. Two independent models, i.e., multiscale virtual particle based Gaussian network model (MVP-GNM) and multiscale virtual particle based anisotropic network model (MVP-ANM), are proposed. Even with a rather coarse grid and a low resolution, the MVP-GNM is able to predict the Debye-Waller factors (B-factors) with considerable good accuracy. Similar properties have also been observed in MVP-ANM. More importantly, in B-factor predictions, the mismatch between the predicted results and experimental ones is predominantly from higher fluctuation regions. Further, it is found that MVP-ANM can deliver a very consistent low-frequency eigenmodes in various scales. This demonstrates the great potential of MVP-ANM in the deformation analysis of low resolution data. With the multiscale rigidity function, the MVP-ENM can be applied to biomolecular data represented in density distribution and atomic coordinates. Further, the great advantage of my MVP-ENM model in computational cost has been demonstrated by using two poliovirus virus structures. Finally, the paper ends with a conclusion.",

There is a need to explore the capability and limitation of algebraic graph theory for molecular and biomolecular modeling, analysis, and prediction. In this work, we propose novel algebraic graph learning (AGL) models that encode high-dimensional physical and biological information into intrinsically low-dimensional representations. The proposed AGL model introduces multiscale weighted colored subgraphs to describe crucial molecular and biomolecular interactions via graph invariants associated with the graph Laplacian, its pseudo-inverse, and adjacent matrix. Additionally, the AGL models are incorporated with an advanced machine learning algorithm to connect the low-dimensional graph representation of biomolecular structures with their macroscopic properties. Three popular protein-ligand binding affinity benchmarks, namely CASF-2007, CASF-2013, and CASF-2016, are employed to validate the accuracy, robustness, and reliability of the present AGL model. Numerical results indicate that the proposed AGL method outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods in the binding affinity predictions of the protein-ligand complexes.",

The SVS model utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and optimizes deep $K$-embedding strategies to encode biomolecular interactions without invoking 3D structure-based docking. We demonstrate the state-of-art performance of SVS for four regression datasets involving protein-ligand binding, protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid binding, and ligand inhibition of protein-protein interactions and five classification datasets for the protein-protein interactions in five biological species.

The particular structure of bond graphs arising from biomolecular systems is established and used to elucidate the relation between thermodynamically closed and open systems. Block diagram representations of the dynamics implied by these bond graphs are used to reveal implicit feedback structures and are linearised to allow the application of control-theoretical methods. Two concepts of modularity are examined: computational modularity where physical correctness is retained and behavioural modularity where module behaviour (such as ultrasensitivity) is retained. As well as providing computational modularity, bond graphs provide a natural formulation of behavioural modularity and reveal the sources of retroactivity. A bond graph approach to reducing retroactivity, and thus inter-module interaction, is shown to require a power supply such as that provided by the ATP = ADP + Pi reaction.

A bond graph interpretation of redox reactions is given which combines bond graphs with the Faraday- equivalent chemical potential. This approach is particularly relevant when the biomolecular system implements chemoelectrical transduction - for example chemiosmosis within the key metabolic pathway of mitochondria: oxidative phosphorylation. An alternative way of implementing computational modularity using bond graphs is introduced and used to give a physically based model of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

Computer simulations capable of taking all interatomic interactions into account are therefore vital. However, even with the best current supercomputing facilities, we are unable to capture enough of the most interesting aspects of their behaviour to properly understand how they work. This limits our ability to design new molecules, to treat diseases, for example. Progress in biomolecular simulation depends crucially on increasing the computing power available. Faster classical computers are in the pipeline, but these provide only incremental improvements.

We first introduce a feedback model representation of the reaction-diffusion system and provide a systematic local stability/instability analysis tool using the root locus of the feedback system. The instability analysis then allows us to analytically derive the conditions for the self-organized spatial pattern formation, or Turing pattern formation, of the bionanomachines.

Here, through minimal physical modelling, we explain how IDP sequence patterning gives rise to nano-scale organisational heterogeneities in condensates. By applying our coarse-grained molecular-dynamics polymer model, which accounts for steric, attractive, and electrostatic interactions, we systematically quantify and map out the emergent morphological phases resulting from a wide range of sequence patterns. We demonstrate how sequences that enable local coil-to-globule transitions within regions of single polymers - driven by a competition between the preferred crowding densities of different regions in the sequence - also exhibit cluster formation in condensates.

The biophysical model, is an alternative approach, speculating that collinearity is caused by physical forces pulling the Hox clusters from a territory where they are inactive to a distinct spatial domain where they are activated in a step by step manner. Hox gene translocations have recently been observed in support of the biophysical model. Furthermore, genetic engineering experiments, performed in embryonic mice, gave rise to some unexpected mutant expressions that biomolecular models could not predict. In several cases when anterior Hoxd genes are deleted, the expression of the genes whose expression is probed in the mutants are impossible to anticipate. On the contrary, the biophysical model offers convincing explanation. All these experimental results support the idea of physical forces being responsible for Hox gene collinearity. In order to test the validity of the various models further, certain experiment involving gene deletions are proposed. The biophysical and biomolecular models predict different results for these experiments, hence the expected outcome will confirm or question the validity of these models.",

    "abstract": "Modeling of biomolecular systems plays an essential role in understanding biological processes, such as ionic flow across channels, protein modification or interaction, and cell signaling. The continuum model described by the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)/Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations has made great contributions towards simulation of these processes. However, the model has shortcomings in its commonly used form and cannot capture (or cannot accurately capture) some important physical properties of biological systems. Considerable efforts have been made to improve the continuum model to account for discrete particle interactions and to make progress in numerical methods to provide accurate and efficient simulation. This review will summarize recent main improvements in continuum modeling for biomolecular systems, with focus on the size-modified models, the coupling of the classical density functional theory and PNP equations, the coupling of polar and nonpolar interactions, and numerical progress.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning force fields offer the ability to simulate biomolecules with quantum mechanical accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, attracting growing attention in biophysics. Meanwhile, leveraging the efficiency of molecular mechanics in modeling solvent molecules and long-range interactions, a hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) model offers a more realistic approach to describing complex biomolecular systems in solution. However, multiscale models with electrostatic embedding require accounting for the polarization of the ML region induced by the MM environment. To address this, we adapt the state-of-the-art NequIP architecture into a polarizable machine learning force field, NepoIP, enabling the modeling of polarization effects based on the external electrostatic potential. We found that the nanosecond MD simulations based on NepoIP/MM are stable for the periodic solvated dipeptide system and the converged sampling shows excellent agreement with the reference QM/MM level. Moreover, we show that a single NepoIP model can be transferable across different MM force fields, as well as extremely different MM environment of water and proteins, laying the foundation for developing a general machine learning biomolecular force field to be used in ML/MM with electrostatic embedding.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules have been widely adopted in biomedical studies. As classical point-charge models continue to be used in routine biomolecular applications, there have been growing demands on developing polarizable force fields for handling more complicated biomolecular processes. Here we focus on a recently proposed polarizable Gaussian Multipole (pGM) model for biomolecular simulations. A key benefit of pGM is its screening of all short-range electrostatic interactions in a physically consistent manner, which is critical for stable charge-fitting and is needed to reproduce molecular anisotropy. Another advantage of pGM is that each atom's multipoles are represented by a single Gaussian function or its derivatives, allowing for more efficient electrostatics than other Gaussian-based models. In this study we present an efficient formulation for the pGM model defined with respect to a local frame formed with a set of covalent basis vectors. The covalent basis vectors are chosen to be along each atom's covalent bonding directions. The new local frame allows molecular flexibility during molecular simulations and facilitates an efficient formulation of analytical electrostatic forces without explicit torque computation. Subsequent numerical tests show that analytical atomic forces agree excellently with numerical finite-difference forces for the tested system. Finally, the new pGM electrostatics algorithm is interfaced with the PME implementation in Amber for molecular simulations under the periodic boundary conditions. To validate the overall pGM/PME electrostatics, we conducted an NVE simulation for a small water box of 512 water molecules. Our results show that, to achieve energy conservation in the polarizable model, it is important to ensure enough accuracy on both PME and induction iteration.",

In this chapter, we address this issue for biomolecular systems using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data, exploiting the dependence of the process noise covariance on the states and parameters, as given in the Langevin framework. We adapt a Hybrid Extended Kalman Filtering technique by updating the process noise covariance at each time step based on estimates. We compare the performance of this framework with different fixed values of process noise covariance in biomolecular system models, including an oscillator model, as well as in experimentally measured data for a negative transcriptional feedback circuit. We find that the Extended Kalman Filter with such process noise covariance update is closer to the optimality condition in the sense that the innovation sequence becomes white and in achieving a balance between the mean square estimation error and parameter convergence time. The results of this chapter may help in the use of Extended Kalman Filters for systems where process noise covariance depends on states and/or parameters.",

While FMRC does not explicitly learn the well-established transfer operator or its eigenfunctions, it can effectively encode the dynamics of leading eigenfunctions of the system transfer operator into its low-dimensional RC space. We further quantitatively compare its performance with several state-of-the-art algorithms by evaluating the quality of Markov state models (MSM) constructed in their respective RC spaces, demonstrating the superiority of FMRC in three increasingly complex biomolecular systems.

    "abstract": "Enhanced sampling techniques are essential for exploring biomolecular conformational dynamics that occur on timescales inaccessible to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study introduces a framework that combines Hamiltonian replica exchange (REST2) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and importance sampling to enhance the mapping of conformational free-energy landscapes. Building on previous applications of DDPMs to temperature replica exchange (TREM), we propose two key improvements. First, we adapt the method to REST2 by treating potential energy as a fluctuating variable. This adaptation allows for more efficient sampling in large biomolecular systems. Second, to further improve resolution in high-barrier regions, we develop an iterative scheme combining replica exchange, DDPM, and importance sampling along known collective variables. Benchmarking on the mini-protein CLN025 demonstrates that DDPM-refined REST2 achieves comparable accuracy to TREM while requiring fewer replicas. Application to the enzyme PTP1B reveals a loop transition pathway consistent with prior complex biased simulations, showcasing the approach's ability to uncover high-barrier transitions with minimal computational overhead with respect to conventional replica exchange approaches. Overall, this hybrid strategy enables more efficient exploration of free-energy landscapes, expanding the utility of generative models in enhanced sampling simulations.",

This principle allows us to focus on the identification of essential energetic components, the optimal parametrization of energies, and the efficient computational implementation of energy variation or minimization. Given the fact that complex biomolecular systems are structurally non-uniform and their interactions occur through contact interfaces, their free energies are associated with various interfaces as well, such as solute-solvent interface, molecular binding interface, lipid domain interface, and membrane surfaces. This fact motivates the inclusion of interface geometry, particular its curvatures, to the parametrization of free energies. Applications of such interface geometry based energetic variational principles are illustrated through three concrete topics: the multiscale modeling of biomolecular electrostatics and solvation that includes the curvature energy of the molecular surface, the formation of microdomains on lipid membrane due to the geometric and molecular mechanics at the lipid interface, and the mean curvature driven protein localization on membrane surfaces. By further implicitly representing the interface using a phase field function over the entire domain, one can simulate the dynamics of the interface and the corresponding energy variation by evolving the phase field function, achieving significant reduction of the number of degrees of freedom and computational complexity. Strategies for improving the efficiency of computational implementations and for extending applications to coarse-graining or multiscale molecular simulations are outlined.",

At a macroscopic level, the phenomenological theory of heat (Fourier law) successfully describes heat transfer and energy flow. However, its microscopic origin is still under debate. This is because the phenomena can contain many-body, multi-scale, nonequilibrium, and even quantum mechanical aspects, which present significant challenges to theories addressing energy transfer phenomena in physics, chemistry and biology. In this paper, we describe our recent theoretical attempts to treat vibrational energy relaxation (VER) in biomolecular systems, including peptide, porphyrin, and protein. First we construct a reduced model using (instantaneous) normal mode analysis, and further add anharmonic coupling between vibrational modes. Using such a model combined with time-dependent perturbation theory for the anharmonic coupling, we derive non-Markovian VER formulas, which are applicable to small timescales such as sub picoseconds. We apply the VER formulas with full atomistic detail to various biomolecular systems, discuss the VER timescales and mechanisms, and compare with experiment if possible. We finally mention further theoretical prospects of the energy transfer phenomena in physics, chemistry, and biology.",

A more detailed imaging model derived from optical coherence theory and quantum electrodynamics is shown to be far more tolerant of electronic damage.

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are small droplets forming spontaneously in biological cells via phase separation. They play a role in many cellular processes, but it is unclear how cells control them. Cellular regulation often relies on post-translational modifications of proteins. For biomolecular condensates, such chemical modifications could alter the molecular interaction of key condensate components. We here test this idea using a theoretical model based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In particular, we describe the chemical reactions using transition-state theory, which accounts for the non-ideality of phase separation. We identify that fast control, like in cell signaling, is only possible when external energy input drives the reaction out of equilibrium. If this reaction differs inside and outside the droplet, it is even possible to control droplet sizes. Such an imbalance in the reaction could be created by enzymes localizing to the droplet. Since this situation is typical inside cells, we speculate that our proposed mechanism is used to stabilize multiple droplets with independently controlled size and count. Our model provides a novel and thermodynamically consistent framework for describing droplets subject to non-equilibrium chemical reactions.",

A notable feature in these processes is the exceptionally high efficiencies ($>$ 95\\%) at which excitation is transferred from the illuminated protein complex site to the reaction centers. The high speeds of excitation propagation within a system of interwoven biomolecular network structures, is yet to be replicated in artificial light harvesting complexes. A clue to unraveling the quantum puzzles of nature may lie in the observations of long lived coherences lasting several picoseconds in the electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes which occurs even in noisy environmental baths. The exact nature of the association between the high energy propagation rates and strength of quantum coherences remains largely unsolved. This review presents recent developments in quantum theories, and links information-theoretic aspects with photosynthetic light-harvesting processes in biomolecular systems. There is examination of various attempts to pinpoint the processes that underpin coherence features arising from the light harvesting activities of biomolecular systems, with particular emphasis on the effects that factors such non-Markovianity, zeno mechanisms, teleportation, quantum predictability and the role of multipartite states have on the quantum dynamics of biomolecular systems.

    "abstract": "Estimating causal queries, such as changes in protein abundance in response to a perturbation, is a fundamental task in the analysis of biomolecular pathways. The estimation requires experimental measurements on the pathway components. However, in practice many pathway components are left unobserved (latent) because they are either unknown, or difficult to measure. Latent variable models (LVMs) are well-suited for such estimation. Unfortunately, LVM-based estimation of causal queries can be inaccurate when parameters of the latent variables are not uniquely identified, or when the number of latent variables is misspecified. This has limited the use of LVMs for causal inference in biomolecular pathways. In this manuscript, we propose a general and practical approach for LVM-based estimation of causal queries. We prove that, despite the challenges above, LVM-based estimators of causal queries are accurate if the queries are identifiable according to Pearl's do-calculus, and describe an algorithm for its estimation. We illustrate the breadth and the practical utility of this approach for estimating causal queries in four synthetic and two experimental case studies, where structures of biomolecular pathways challenge the existing methods for causal query estimation.

Enhanced conformational sampling techniques are thus in great demand. A simulation in generalized ensemble performs a random walk in potential energy space and can overcome this difficulty. From only one simulation run, one can obtain canonical-ensemble averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature by the single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. In this article we review uses of the generalized-ensemble algorithms in biomolecular systems. Three well-known methods, namely, multicanonical algorithm, simulated tempering, and replica-exchange method, are described first.

We show that the free energy of the system possessing a wider binding energy spectrum is almost surely lower compared with the system possessing a narrower energy spectrum. Our predictions imply that low-affinity binding scores, usually wasted in protein-protein and protein-DNA docking algorithms, can be efficiently utilized to compute the free energy.

Furthermore, we show that we can predict the maximum number of distinct condensates in a mixture without knowing the details of the pairwise interactions.

Even both solvent and cosolvent are good to the polymer, we demonstrate that strong polymer-cosolvent affinity induces the formation of a single-chain condensate. Even though all the molecular interactions are soft, the potential of mean force between two condensates exhibits an anomalous feature of long-range hard-wall repulsion, which cannot be categorized into any existing types of inter-chain interactions. This repulsion is enhanced as either the affinity or the bulk cosolvent fraction increases. The underlying mechanism is cosolvent regulation manifested as a discontinuous local condensation of cosolvent.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we systematically review weighted persistent homology (WPH) models and their applications in biomolecular data analysis. Essentially, the weight value, which reflects physical, chemical and biological properties, can be assigned to vertices (atom centers), edges (bonds), or higher order simplexes (cluster of atoms), depending on the biomolecular structure, function, and dynamics properties. Further, we propose the first localized weighted persistent homology (LWPH). Inspired by the great success of element specific persistent homology (ESPH), we do not treat biomolecules as an inseparable system like all previous weighted models, instead we decompose them into a series of local domains, which may be overlapped with each other. The general persistent homology or weighted persistent homology analysis is then applied on each of these local domains. In this way, functional properties, that are embedded in local structures, can be revealed. Our model has been applied to systematically studying DNA structures. It has been found that our LWPH based features can be used to successfully discriminate the A-, B-, and Z-types of DNA. More importantly, our LWPH based PCA model can identify two configurational states of DNA structure in ion liquid environment, which can be revealed only by the complicated helical coordinate system. The great consistence with the helical-coordinate model demonstrates that our model captures local structure variations so well that it is comparable with geometric models. Moreover, geometric measurements are usually defined in very local regions. For instance, the helical-coordinate system is limited to one or two basepairs. However, our LWPH can quantitatively characterize structure information in local regions or domains with arbitrary sizes and shapes, where traditional geometrical measurements fail.",

    "title": "Differential geometry-based solvation and electrolyte transport models for biomolecular modeling: a review",
    "abstract": "This chapter reviews the differential geometry-based solvation and electrolyte transport for biomolecular solvation that have been developed over the past decade. A key component of these methods is the differential geometry of surfaces theory, as applied to the solvent-solute boundary. In these approaches, the solvent-solute boundary is determined by a variational principle that determines the major physical observables of interest, for example, biomolecular surface area, enclosed volume, electrostatic potential, ion density, electron density, etc. Recently, differential geometry theory has been used to define the surfaces that separate the microscopic (solute) domains for biomolecules from the macroscopic (solvent) domains. In these approaches, the microscopic domains are modeled with atomistic or quantum mechanical descriptions, while continuum mechanics models (including fluid mechanics, elastic mechanics, and continuum electrostatics) are applied to the macroscopic domains. This multiphysics description is integrated through an energy functional formalism and the resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is employed to derive a variety of governing partial differential equations for different solvation and transport processes; e.g., the Laplace-Beltrami equation for the solvent-solute interface, Poisson or Poisson-Boltzmann equations for electrostatic potentials, the Nernst-Planck equation for ion densities, and the Kohn-Sham equation for solute electron density. Extensive validation of these models has been carried out over hundreds of molecules, including proteins and ion channels, and the experimental data have been compared in terms of solvation energies, voltage-current curves, and density distributions. We also propose a new quantum model for electrolyte transport.",

    "title": "Computing Long Timescale Biomolecular Dynamics using Quasi-Stationary Distribution Kinetic Monte Carlo (QSD-KMC)",
    "abstract": "It is a challenge to obtain an accurate model of the state-to-state dynamics of a complex biological system from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In recent years, Markov State Models have gained immense popularity for computing state-to-state dynamics from a pool of short MD simulations. However, the assumption that the underlying dynamics on the reduced space is Markovian induces a systematic bias in the model, especially in biomolecular systems with complicated energy landscapes. To address this problem, we have devised a new approach we call quasi-stationary distribution kinetic Monte Carlo (QSD-KMC) that gives accurate long time state-to-state evolution while retaining the entire time resolution even when the dynamics is highly non-Markovian. The proposed method is a kinetic Monte Carlo approach that takes advantage of two concepts: (i) the quasi-stationary distribution and (ii) dynamical corrections theory. Implementation of QSD-KMC imposes stricter requirements on the lengths of the trajectories than in a Markov State Model approach, as the trajectories must be long enough to dephase. However, the QSD-KMC model produces state-to-state trajectories that are statistically indistinguishable from an MD trajectory mapped onto the discrete set of states, for an arbitrary choice of state decomposition. Furthermore, the aforementioned concepts can be used to construct a Monte Carlo approach to optimize the state boundaries regardless of the initial choice of states. We demonstrate the QSD-KMC method on two one-dimensional model systems, one of which is a driven nonequilibrium system, and on two well-characterized biomolecular systems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce multiscale persistent functions for biomolecular structure characterization. The essential idea is to combine our multiscale rigidity functions with persistent homology analysis, so as to construct a series of multiscale persistent functions, particularly multiscale persistent entropies, for structure characterization. To clarify the fundamental idea of our method, the multiscale persistent entropy model is discussed in great detail. Mathematically, unlike the previous persistent entropy or topological entropy, a special resolution parameter is incorporated into our model. Various scales can be achieved by tuning its value. Physically, our multiscale persistent entropy can be used in conformation entropy evaluation. More specifically, it is found that our method incorporates in it a natural classification scheme. This is achieved through a density filtration of a multiscale rigidity function built from bond and/or dihedral angle distributions. To further validate our model, a systematical comparison with the traditional entropy evaluation model is done. It is found that our model is able to preserve the intrinsic topological features of biomolecular data much better than traditional approaches, particularly for resolutions in the mediate range. Moreover, our method can be successfully used in protein classification. For a test database with around nine hundred proteins, a clear separation between all-alpha and all-beta proteins can be achieved, using only the dihedral and pseudo-bond angle information. Finally, a special protein structure index (PSI) is proposed, for the first time, to describe the 'regularity' of protein structures. Essentially, PSI can be used to describe the 'regularity' information in any systems.",

During this overview, we take the opportunity to clarify several subtle issues relating to entanglement in such biomolecular systems, including the role of entanglement in biological function, the complexity of dynamical modeling that is required to capture the salient features of entanglement in such biomolecular systems, and the relationship between entanglement and other quantum mechanical features that are observed and predicted in light harvesting complexes. Finally, we suggest possible extensions of the current work and also review the options for experimental confirmation of the predicted entanglement phenomena in light harvesting complexes.",

    "title": "Theoretical restrictions on longest implicit timescales in Markov state models of biomolecular dynamics",
    "abstract": "Markov state models (MSMs) have been widely used to analyze computer simulations of various biomolecular systems. They can capture conformational transitions much slower than an average or maximal length of a single molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory from the set of trajectories used to build the MSM. A rule of thumb claiming that the slowest implicit timescale captured by an MSM should be comparable by the order of magnitude to the aggregate duration of all MD trajectories used to build this MSM has been known in the field. However, this rule have never been formally proved. In this work, we present analytical results for the slowest timescale in several types of MSMs, supporting the above rule. We conclude that the slowest implicit timescale equals the product of the aggregate sampling and four factors that quantify: (1) how much statistics on the conformational transitions corresponding to the longest implicit timescale is available, (2) how good the sampling of the destination Markov state is, (3) the gain in statistics from using a sliding window for counting transitions between Markov states, and (4) a bias in the estimate of the implicit timescale arising from finite sampling of the conformational transitions. We demonstrate that in many practically important cases all these four factors are on the order of unity, and we analyze possible scenarios that could lead to their significant deviation from unity. Overall, we provide for the first time analytical results on the slowest timescales captured by MSMs. These results can guide further practical applications of MSMs to biomolecular dynamics and allow for higher computational efficiency of simulations.",

This paradigm commands us to map out all possible structures and sample transitions between them, a task that becomes impossible for large-scale systems such as biomolecular complexes. To arrive at scalable molecular models, we suggest moving away from global state descriptions to a set of coupled models that each describe the dynamics of local domains or sites of the molecular system. We describe limitations in the current state-of-the-art global-state Markovian modeling approaches and then introduce Markov Field Models as an umbrella term that includes models from various scientific communities, including Independent Markov Decomposition, Ising and Potts Models, and (Dynamic) Graphical Models, and evaluate their use for computational molecular biology.

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates formed through the phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids are widely observed, offering a fundamental means of organizing intracellular materials in a membrane-less fashion. Traditionally, these condensates have been regarded as homogeneous isotropic liquids. However, in analogy with some synthetic copolymer systems, our recent theoretical research has demonstrated that model biomolecular condensates can exhibit a microemulsion-like internal structure, contingent upon the specific sequence, inter-chain site-site interactions, and concentrated phase polymer density. In this study, we present a microscopic dynamical theory for the self-diffusion constant and viscosity of concentrated unentangled A/B regular multiblock copolymer solutions. Our approach integrates static equilibrium local and microdomain scale structural information obtained from PRISM integral equation theory and the time evolution of the autocorrelation function of monomer scale forces at the center-of-mass level that determine the polymer diffusion constant and viscosity in a weak caging regime far from a glass or gel transition. We focus on regular multi-block systems both for simplicity and for its relevance to synthetic macromolecular science. The impact of sequence and inter-chain attraction strength on the slowing down of copolymer mass transport and flow due to local clustering enhanced collisional friction and retardation of motion due to emergent microdomain scale ordering are established. Analytic analysis and metrics employed in the study of biomolecular condensates are employed to identify key order parameters that quantity how attractive forces, packing structure, multiblock sequence, and copolymer density determine dynamical slowing down above and below the crossover to a fluctuating polymeric microemulsion state.",

Experimental data are rationalized by physical modeling using analytical theory, molecular dynamics, and polymer field-theoretic simulations, indicating that interchain ion bridges enhance LLPS of polyelectrolytes such as Caprin1 and the high valency of ATP-magnesium is a significant factor for its colocalization with the condensed phases, as similar trends are observed for other IDRs. The electrostatic nature of these features complements ATP's involvement in $\\pi$-related interactions and as an amphiphilic hydrotrope, underscoring a general role of biomolecular condensates in modulating ion concentrations and its functional ramifications.",

    "abstract": "A fluctuation theorem is examined for the first-passage time of a biomolecular machine in a nonequilibrium steady-state. For such machines in which the driven, observable process is coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative fashion, the entropy produced along first-passage trajectories is no longer uniform, resulting in a breakdown of this relation. Here, we consider the canonical model for this type of system, a kinetic scheme for conformation-modulated single-enzyme catalysis, as we (i) determine the circumstances under which this fluctuation theorem can be restored; (ii) assess what its violation reveals about the hidden dynamics; and (iii) characterize the general form of the deviation from this relation. Kinetic evaluations are performed using a novel, efficient pathway analysis technique, allowing us to attain some surprising and fairly straightforward results from relatively complex calculations. We find that in the absence of hidden current, a fluctuation theorem can be written for the first-passage time of the observable process, and we demonstrate that this is a general feature applicable to a wide variety of complex networks. The validity of this relation can be experimentally tested, with its violation serving as a signature of hidden detailed balance breaking. In addition, we obtain a remarkably compact exact expression for the integrated correction to this first-passage time fluctuation theorem, which indicates that the kinetic branching ratio, defined as the ratio of the forward observable process probability to the backward one, is bounded by the entropy production associated with the first-passage work (i.e., the work applied along a first-passage trajectory). These results provide detailed insight into the rich connections between dynamic measurements and the underlying nonequilibrium thermodynamics in complex biomolecular networks.",

However, in case of complex structured models such as images, graphs or three-dimensional (3D) objects,generic prior distributions tend to favor models that differ largely from those observed in the real world. Here we explore the use of diffusion models as priors that are combined with experimental data within a Bayesian framework. We use 3D point clouds to represent 3D objects such as household items or biomolecular complexes formed from proteins and nucleic acids. We train diffusion models that generate coarse-grained 3D structures at a medium resolution and integrate these with incomplete and noisy experimental data. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we focus on the reconstruction of biomolecular assemblies from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images, which is an important inverse problem in structural biology. We find that posterior sampling with diffusion model priors allows for 3D reconstruction from very sparse, low-resolution and partial observations.",

For a restricted class of driven systems governed by Markov dynamics and local detailed balance, stochastic thermodynamics has evolved to fill this gap and to provide fundamental constraints and guiding principles. The next step is to advance stochastic thermodynamics from simple model systems to complex systems with ten thousands or even millions degrees of freedom. Biomolecules operating in the presence of chemical gradients and mechanical forces are a prime example for this challenge.

Recently, patchy particle models, representing proteins as sphere with a repulsive core and directional attractive patches, have emerged as a powerful tool. However, these simulations are typically limited by slow dynamics and struggle to capture the full range of material properties of fluid-like condensates.

By incorporating flexible patches and weak isotropic attractions between cores, our models preserve key equilibrium characteristics, including the phase behavior and the local structure of the condensate, while significantly accelerating the system dynamics.

    "abstract": "Phase-separated biomolecular condensates containing proteins and RNAs can assemble into higher-order structures by forming thermodynamically stable interfaces between immiscible phases. Using a minimal model of a protein/RNA interaction network, we demonstrate how a 'shared' protein species that partitions into both phases of a multiphase condensate can function as a tunable surfactant that modulates the interfacial properties. We use Monte Carlo simulations and free-energy calculations to identify conditions under which a low concentration of this shared species is sufficient to trigger a wetting transition. We also describe a numerical approach based on classical density functional theory to predict concentration profiles and surface tensions directly from the model protein/RNA interaction network. Finally, we show that the wetting phase diagrams that emerge from our calculations can be understood in terms of a simple model of selective adsorption to a fluctuating interface. Our work shows how a low-concentration protein species might function as a biological switch for regulating multiphase condensate morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Engineering biology requires precise control of biomolecular circuits, and Cybergenetics is the field dedicated to achieving this goal. A significant challenge in developing controllers for cellular functions is designing systems that can effectively manage molecular noise. To address this, there has been increasing effort to develop model-based controllers for stochastic biomolecular systems, where a major difficulty lies in accurately solving the chemical master equation. In this work we develop a framework for optimal and Model Predictive Control of stochastic gene regulatory networks with three key advantageous features: high computational efficiency, the capacity to control the overall probability density function enabling the fine-tuning of the cell population to obtain complex shapes and behaviors (including bimodality and other emergent properties), and the capacity to handle high levels of intrinsic molecular noise. Our method exploits an efficient approximation of the Chemical Master Equation using Partial Integro-Differential Equations, which additionally enables the development of an effective adjoint-based optimization. We illustrate the performance of the methods presented through two relevant studies in Synthetic Biology: shaping bimodal cell populations and tracking moving target distributions via inducible gene regulatory circuits.",

The associated biomolecular signaling network involves a negative feedback at the level of the Aux/IAA proteins which mediate the influence of auxin (the signal) on the ARF transcription factors (the drivers of the response). To probe the role of this feedback, we consider alternative in silico signaling networks implementing different operating principles. By a comparative analysis, we find that the presence of a negative regulatory feedback loop allows the system to have a far larger sensitivity in its dynamical response to auxin. At the same time, this sensitivity does not prevent the system from being highly resilient. Given this insight, we reconsider previously published models and build a new quantitative and calibrated biomolecular model of auxin signaling.",

We propose an approximate method to perform optimal experimental design of such perturbation profiles. To estimate the mutual information we perform a multivariate log-normal approximation of the joint distribution over parameters and observations and scan the design space using Metropolis-Hastings sampling.

Liquid jets are widely used to deliver samples into the XFEL beam. The impact of the X-ray pulse leads to vaporization and explosion of the liquid jet, while the expanding gas triggers the formation of shock wave trains traveling along the jet, which may affect biomolecular samples before they have been probed. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the structural dynamics of shock waves after an X-ray impact. Analysis of the density in the jet revealed shock waves that form close to the explosion center, travel along the jet with supersonic velocities and decay exponentially with an attenuation length proportional to the jet diameter. A trailing shock wave formed after the first shock wave, similar to the shock wave trains in experiments. Although using purely classical models in the simulations, the resulting explosion geometry and shock wave dynamics closely resemble experimental findings, and they highlight the importance of atomistic details for modeling shock wave attenuation.",

In this study, we address this challenge in the context of the well-studied problem of classifying genomic sequences into different taxonomic units (strain, phyla, order, etc.). We propose a novel technique that employs signal processing in tandem with Gaussian mixture models to improve the spectral representation of a sequence and subsequently the taxonomic classification accuracies. The sequences are first transformed into spectra, and projected to a subspace, where sequences belonging to different taxons are better distinguishable.

We investigate therefore the dynamics of soft films adsorbed onto a solid quartz surface within a continuum mechanics approach using both the Maxwell and the Voight/Kelvin models of viscoelasticity and their combination. The rigorous expressions derived for the acoustic response of a quartz crystal oscillator, accounting for both interfacial (sliding) friction and internal friction (viscosity), demonstrate that the QCM can be used as a sensor for quantitative characteristization of friction effects as well as for ``in situ'' measurements of mechanical properties of adsorbed biomolecular films.",

The latter are due either to propagating environmental modes or to local fluctuations with a finite localization length. A simple toy model of a single donor-acceptor pair with spatially separated chromophore sites allows to investigate the influence of these spatial correlations on the quantum coherent excitation transfer. The sound velocity of the solvent determines the wave lengths of the environmental modes, which, in turn, has to be compared to the spatial distance of the chromophore sites. When the wave length exceeds the distance between donor and acceptor site, we find strong suppression of decoherence. In addition, we consider two spatially separated donor-acceptor pairs under the influence of propagating environmental modes. Depending on their wave lengths fixed by the sound velocity of the solvent material, the spatial range of correlations may extend over typical interpair distances, which can lead to an increase of the decohering influence of the solvent. Surprisingly, this effect is counteracted by increasing temperature.",

Here we focus on a striking recent empirical finding concerning an illumination-driven transition in the biomolecular membrane architecture of {\\it Rsp. Photometricum} purple bacteria. Using stochastic realisations to describe a hopping rate model for excitation transfer, we show numerically and analytically that this surprising shift in preferred architectures can be traced to the interplay between the excitation kinetics and the reaction center dynamics. The net effect is that the bacteria profit from efficient metabolism at low illumination intensities while using dissipation to avoid an oversupply of energy at high illumination intensities.",

These equations suggest that the transport in such cases rely on both drift and diffusion phenomena. The presence of disorder and field effects makes the equations nonlinear and together with cooperativity, these enhance the charge and energy transport. The generalized drift diffusion expression connects the adiabatic band and nonadiabatic hopping transport mechanisms, well suited for any complex organic semiconductors or assemblies of bio molecular systems. Here we have proposed donor-acceptor (DA) reaction state model, which examines the probability of charge transfer and the rate between two distinct transition state identities. From our analytical equations, we suggest that charge and energy transport property in DA states can be tuned by only a single parameter, i.e., the chemical potential. Importantly, we find the non-equilibrium assisted drift-diffusion transport at non- steady state regime in 2D and 3D semiconducting devices. The numerical results clearly support our unified analytical equations, which goes beyond Einstein's diffusion law even in quasi- equilibrium cases.",

We find that long DNA molecules that have binding affinity for the nanostars are preferentially enriched on the interface of nanostar droplets, thus acting as surfactants. Fluorescent measurements indicate that, in certain conditions, the interfacial density of the surfactant is around 20 per square micron, indicative of a sparse brush-like structure of the long, polymeric DNA. Increasing surfactant concentration leads to decreased droplet size, down to the sub-micron scale, consistent with arrest of droplet coalescence by the disjoining pressure created by the brush-like surfactant layer. Added DNA surfactant also keeps droplets from adhering to both hydrophobic and hydrophilic solid surfaces, apparently due to this same disjoining effect of the surfactant layer. We thus demonstrate control of the size and adhesive properties of droplets of a biomolecular liquid, with implications for basic biophysical understanding of such droplets, as well as for their applied use.",

Here, we develop a model biomolecular system that permits quantitative investigation of such dynamics, particularly by coupling a phase-separating system of DNA nanostars to an in vitro transcription reaction. The DNA nanostars' sequence is designed such that they self-assemble into liquid droplets only in the presence of a transcribed single-stranded RNA linker. We find that nanostar droplets form with a substantial delay and non-linear response to the kinetics of RNA synthesis. In addition, we utilize the compartments generated by the phase-separation process to engineer an activator/repressor network, where the transcription reaction activates the formation of droplets, and then droplets suppress the transcription reaction by segregating transcription components inside them.

For sufficiently strong coupling, an instability arises and unbounded system growth ensues in the absence of mechanical load. Unexpectedly, the same type of instability can lead to perfect stability under mechanical load, whereby adhesion clusters adjust their size to withstand arbitrarily large forces without breaking, a phenomenon we term perfect stabilization. We derive state diagrams that characterize adhesion stability under stationary loads and show that perfect stabilization also occurs under dynamic loading on physiologically relevant timescales. Finally, we show that perfect stabilization and related instabilities are generic phenomenona that can be realized in many different ways if internal molecule states are coupled to adsorption in nonequilibrium.",

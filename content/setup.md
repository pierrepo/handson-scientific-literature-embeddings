# Setup the hands-on environment

## Install uv

`uv` is a relatively new tool to manage Python environments and dependencies. It is similar to `pipenv` or `poetry`, but with a focus on simplicity and speed.

Install `uv` on your user account (on Linux / macOS):

```bash
$ wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

For alternative installation methods, see the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods).

If `uv` is properly installed, you should be able to run the following command to check `uv`'s version:

```bash
$ uv self version
uv 0.7.8
```

```{note}
You might obtain a slightly different version number, which is fine. The important thing is that `uv` is installed and working.
```


## Prepare files and environment

Clone the GitHub repository with the hands-on material:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pierrepo/handson-scientific-literature-embeddings
$ cd handson-scientific-literature-embeddings
```

Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
$ uv sync
```

## Let's go ðŸš€


Run Jupyter Lab:

```bash
$ uv run jupyter lab
```

The first part of this hands-on session does not require any coding. Its goal is to help you become familiar with key concepts such as tokens and embeddings.

In the second part, you will run code to explore scientific literature using embeddings. You will use the Jupyter Lab interface to execute Python code and interact with data. We recommend starting with a new notebook and copying commands as they are provided. However, if you are not familiar with Python or Jupyter Lab, you can use the notebooks available in the `content` directory.

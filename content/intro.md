# Hands-on: Exploring physical sciences scientific literature using embeddings

> Welcome to the world of large language models ✨

In this hands-on session, we will explore how to use **embeddings** (high-dimensional vectors that integrate semantic meaning) to analyze scientific literature in the physical sciences. We will cover the following topics:
- Manipulating the concepts of tokens and embeddings
- Exploring embeddings in high-dimensional space
- Performing vector arithmetic with embeddings
- Visualizing embeddings with dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and UMAP
- Using embeddings to analyze scientific literature
